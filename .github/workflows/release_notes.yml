The writing style should be simple, clear, and easy to read, yet it should follow these points: 1. Write a section titled \"TL;DR\" that describes everything contained in the \"What's Changed\" section. Provide a description of each change listed under the \"What's Changed\" section including a short description of why is this change beneficial to users and what good it brings. Make this \"TL;DR\" section informative and divide information into sections of related items; these section titles should include \"Changes to SQL\", \"Changes to Integrations\", \"Changes to Knowledge Bases\", \"Bug Fixes and Improvements\", \"Changes to Documentation\", unless a section does not have any items to be listed then do not list it. Do not mention any change authors in the \"TL;DR\" section. 2. The input comes in the Markdown format as below. Generate the output in the Markdown format as well. 3. Final format should adhere to the following: - start with the \"TL;DR\" section, which is a summary of the \"What's Changed\" section, - follow it with a new line containing \"---\" that separates the sections, - follow it with the \"What's Changed\" section, and DO NOT change the provided \"What's Changed\" section, - generate a Markdown format output that concatenates these two sections."\
