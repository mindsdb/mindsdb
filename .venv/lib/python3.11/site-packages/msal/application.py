            For :class:`PublicClientApplication`, you use `None` here.
            For :class:`ConfidentialClientApplication`,
            it can be a string containing client secret,
            or an X509 certificate container in this form::

                {
                    "private_key": "...-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----... in PEM format",
                    "thumbprint": "A1B2C3D4E5F6...",

                    "passphrase": "Passphrase if the private_key is encrypted (Optional. Added in version 1.6.0)",
                }

            MSAL Python requires a "private_key" in PEM format.
            If your cert is in a PKCS12 (.pfx) format, you can also
            `convert it to PEM and get the thumbprint <https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/07d10639d7e47f4852eaeb74aef5d569db499d6e/sdk/identity/azure-identity/azure/identity/_credentials/certificate.py#L101-L123>`_.

            The thumbprint is available in your app's registration in Azure Portal.
            Alternatively, you can `calculate the thumbprint <https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/07d10639d7e47f4852eaeb74aef5d569db499d6e/sdk/identity/azure-identity/azure/identity/_credentials/certificate.py#L94-L97>`_.

            *Added in version 0.5.0*:
            public_certificate (optional) is public key certificate
            which will be sent through 'x5c' JWT header only for
            subject name and issuer authentication to support cert auto rolls.

            Per `specs <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.6>`_,
            "the certificate containing
            the public key corresponding to the key used to digitally sign the
            JWS MUST be the first certificate.  This MAY be followed by
            additional certificates, with each subsequent certificate being the
            one used to certify the previous one."
            However, your certificate's issuer may use a different order.
            So, if your attempt ends up with an error AADSTS700027 -
            "The provided signature value did not match the expected signature value",
            you may try use only the leaf cert (in PEM/str format) instead.

            *Added in version 1.13.0*:
            It can also be a completely pre-signed assertion that you've assembled yourself.
            Simply pass a container containing only the key "client_assertion", like this::

                {
                    "client_assertion": "...a JWT with claims aud, exp, iss, jti, nbf, and sub..."
                }

            .. admonition:: Supporting reading client cerficates from PFX files

                *Added in version 1.29.0*:
                Feed in a dictionary containing the path to a PFX file::

                    {
                        "private_key_pfx_path": "/path/to/your.pfx",
                        "passphrase": "Passphrase if the private_key is encrypted (Optional. Added in version 1.6.0)",
                    }

                The following command will generate a .pfx file from your .key and .pem file::

                    openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.pfx -inkey privateKey.key -in certificate.pem

        :type client_credential: Union[dict, str]

        :param dict client_claims:
            *Added in version 0.5.0*:
            It is a dictionary of extra claims that would be signed by
            by this :class:`ConfidentialClientApplication` 's private key.
            For example, you can use {"client_ip": "x.x.x.x"}.
            You may also override any of the following default claims::

                {
                    "aud": the_token_endpoint,
                    "iss": self.client_id,
                    "sub": same_as_issuer,
                    "exp": now + 10_min,
                    "iat": now,
                    "jti": a_random_uuid
                }

        :param str authority:
            A URL that identifies a token authority. It should be of the format
            ``https://login.microsoftonline.com/your_tenant``
            By default, we will use ``https://login.microsoftonline.com/common``

            *Changed in version 1.17*: you can also use predefined constant
            and a builder like this::

                from msal.authority import (
                    AuthorityBuilder,
                    AZURE_US_GOVERNMENT, AZURE_CHINA, AZURE_PUBLIC)
                my_authority = AuthorityBuilder(AZURE_PUBLIC, "contoso.onmicrosoft.com")
                # Now you get an equivalent of
                # "https://login.microsoftonline.com/contoso.onmicrosoft.com"

                # You can feed such an authority to msal's ClientApplication
                from msal import PublicClientApplication
                app = PublicClientApplication("my_client_id", authority=my_authority, ...)

        :param bool validate_authority: (optional) Turns authority validation
            on or off. This parameter default to true.
        :param TokenCache token_cache:
            Sets the token cache used by this ClientApplication instance.
            By default, an in-memory cache will be created and used.
        :param http_client: (optional)
            Your implementation of abstract class HttpClient <msal.oauth2cli.http.http_client>
            Defaults to a requests session instance.
            Since MSAL 1.11.0, the default session would be configured
            to attempt one retry on connection error.
            If you are providing your own http_client,
            it will be your http_client's duty to decide whether to perform retry.

        :param verify: (optional)
            It will be passed to the
            `verify parameter in the underlying requests library
            <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/v2.9.1/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification>`_
            This does not apply if you have chosen to pass your own Http client
        :param proxies: (optional)
            It will be passed to the
            `proxies parameter in the underlying requests library
            <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/v2.9.1/user/advanced/#proxies>`_
            This does not apply if you have chosen to pass your own Http client
        :param timeout: (optional)
            It will be passed to the
            `timeout parameter in the underlying requests library
            <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/v2.9.1/user/advanced/#timeouts>`_
            This does not apply if you have chosen to pass your own Http client
        :param app_name: (optional)
            You can provide your application name for Microsoft telemetry purposes.
            Default value is None, means it will not be passed to Microsoft.
        :param app_version: (optional)
            You can provide your application version for Microsoft telemetry purposes.
            Default value is None, means it will not be passed to Microsoft.
        :param list[str] client_capabilities: (optional)
            Allows configuration of one or more client capabilities, e.g. ["CP1"].

            Client capability is meant to inform the Microsoft identity platform
            (STS) what this client is capable for,
            so STS can decide to turn on certain features.
            For example, if client is capable to handle *claims challenge*,
            STS can then issue CAE access tokens to resources
            knowing when the resource emits *claims challenge*
            the client will be capable to handle.

            Implementation details:
            Client capability is implemented using "claims" parameter on the wire,
            for now.
            MSAL will combine them into
            `claims parameter <https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0-final.html#ClaimsParameter>`_
            which you will later provide via one of the acquire-token request.

        :param str azure_region: (optional)
            Instructs MSAL to use the Entra regional token service. This legacy feature is only available to
            first-party applications. Only ``acquire_token_for_client()`` is supported.

            Supports 3 values:

              ``azure_region=None`` - meaning no region is used. This is the default value.
              ``azure_region="some_region"`` - meaning the specified region is used.
              ``azure_region=True`` - meaning MSAL will try to auto-detect the region. This is not recommended.

            .. note::
                Region auto-discovery has been tested on VMs and on Azure Functions. It is unreliable.
                Applications using this option should configure a short timeout.

                For more details and for the values of the region string
                  see https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/msal/dotnet/resources/region-discovery-troubleshooting

            New in version 1.12.0.

        :param list[str] exclude_scopes: (optional)
            Historically MSAL hardcodes `offline_access` scope,
            which would allow your app to have prolonged access to user's data.
            If that is unnecessary or undesirable for your app,
            now you can use this parameter to supply an exclusion list of scopes,
            such as ``exclude_scopes = ["offline_access"]``.

        :param dict http_cache:
            MSAL has long been caching tokens in the ``token_cache``.
            Recently, MSAL also introduced a concept of ``http_cache``,
            by automatically caching some finite amount of non-token http responses,
            so that *long-lived*
            ``PublicClientApplication`` and ``ConfidentialClientApplication``
            would be more performant and responsive in some situations.

            This ``http_cache`` parameter accepts any dict-like object.
            If not provided, MSAL will use an in-memory dict.

            If your app is a command-line app (CLI),
            you would want to persist your http_cache across different CLI runs.
            The following recipe shows a way to do so::

                # Just add the following lines at the beginning of your CLI script
                import sys, atexit, pickle
                http_cache_filename = sys.argv[0] + ".http_cache"
                try:
                    with open(http_cache_filename, "rb") as f:
                        persisted_http_cache = pickle.load(f)  # Take a snapshot
                except (
                        FileNotFoundError,  # Or IOError in Python 2
                        pickle.UnpicklingError,  # A corrupted http cache file
                        ):
                    persisted_http_cache = {}  # Recover by starting afresh
                atexit.register(lambda: pickle.dump(
                    # When exit, flush it back to the file.
                    # It may occasionally overwrite another process's concurrent write,
                    # but that is fine. Subsequent runs will reach eventual consistency.
                    persisted_http_cache, open(http_cache_file, "wb")))

                # And then you can implement your app as you normally would
                app = msal.PublicClientApplication(
                    "your_client_id",
                    ...,
                    http_cache=persisted_http_cache,  # Utilize persisted_http_cache
                    ...,
                    #token_cache=...,  # You may combine the old token_cache trick
                        # Please refer to token_cache recipe at
                        # https://msal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#msal.SerializableTokenCache
                    )
                app.acquire_token_interactive(["your", "scope"], ...)

            Content inside ``http_cache`` are cheap to obtain.
            There is no need to share them among different apps.

            Content inside ``http_cache`` will contain no tokens nor
            Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Encryption is unnecessary.

        :param boolean instance_discovery:
            Historically, MSAL would connect to a central endpoint located at
            ``https://login.microsoftonline.com`` to acquire some metadata,
            especially when using an unfamiliar authority.
            This behavior is known as Instance Discovery.

            This parameter defaults to None, which enables the Instance Discovery.

            If you know some authorities which you allow MSAL to operate with as-is,
            without involving any Instance Discovery, the recommended pattern is::

                known_authorities = frozenset([  # Treat your known authorities as const
                    "https://contoso.com/adfs", "https://login.azs/foo"])
                ...
                authority = "https://contoso.com/adfs"  # Assuming your app will use this
                app1 = PublicClientApplication(
                    "client_id",
                    authority=authority,
                    # Conditionally disable Instance Discovery for known authorities
                    instance_discovery=authority not in known_authorities,
                    )

            If you do not know some authorities beforehand,
            yet still want MSAL to accept any authority that you will provide,
            you can use a ``False`` to unconditionally disable Instance Discovery.

            New in version 1.19.0.

        :param boolean allow_broker:
            Deprecated. Please use ``enable_broker_on_windows`` instead.

        :param boolean enable_pii_log:
            When enabled, logs may include PII (Personal Identifiable Information).
            This can be useful in troubleshooting broker behaviors.
            The default behavior is False.

            MSAL will append ".well-known/openid-configuration" to the authority
            and retrieve the OIDC metadata from there, to figure out the endpoints.

            Note: Broker will NOT be used for OIDC authority.

            It is a list of case-sensitive strings.

            An opaque value used by the client to

            By default, no prompt value will be sent, not even string ``"none"``.
            You will have to specify a value explicitly.

            OPTIONAL. Maximum Authentication Age.
            Specifies the allowable elapsed time in seconds
            since the last time the End-User was actively authenticated.
            If the elapsed time is greater than this value,
            Microsoft identity platform will actively re-authenticate the End-User.

            MSAL Python will also automatically validate the auth_time in ID token.

            New in version 1.15.

        :param str response_mode:
            OPTIONAL. Specifies the method with which response parameters should be returned.
            The default value is equivalent to ``query``, which is still secure enough in MSAL Python
            (because MSAL Python does not transfer tokens via query parameter in the first place).
            For even better security, we recommend using the value ``form_post``.
            In "form_post" mode, response parameters
            will be encoded as HTML form values that are transmitted via the HTTP POST method and
            encoded in the body using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format.
            Valid values can be either "form_post" for HTTP POST to callback URI or
            "query" (the default) for HTTP GET with parameters encoded in query string.

            **What is a broker, and why use it?**

            A broker is a component installed on your device.
            Broker implicitly gives your device an identity. By using a broker,
            your device becomes a factor that can satisfy MFA (Multi-factor authentication).
            This factor would become mandatory
            if a tenant's admin enables a corresponding Conditional Access (CA) policy.
            The broker's presence allows Microsoft identity platform
            to have higher confidence that the tokens are being issued to your device,
            and that is more secure.

            An additional benefit of broker is,
            it runs as a long-lived process with your device's OS,
            and maintains its own cache,
            so that your broker-enabled apps (even a CLI)
            could automatically SSO from a previously established signed-in session.

            **You shall only enable broker when your app:**

            1. is running on supported platforms,
               and already registered their corresponding redirect_uri

               * ``ms-appx-web://Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin/your_client_id``
                 if your app is expected to run on Windows 10+

            2. installed broker dependency,
               e.g. ``pip install msal[broker]>=1.25,<2``.

            3. tested with ``acquire_token_interactive()`` and ``acquire_token_silent()``.

            **The fallback behaviors of MSAL Python's broker support**

            MSAL will either error out, or silently fallback to non-broker flows.

            1. MSAL will ignore the `enable_broker_...` and bypass broker
               on those auth flows that are known to be NOT supported by broker.
               This includes ADFS, B2C, etc..
               For other "could-use-broker" scenarios, please see below.
            2. MSAL errors out when app developer opted-in to use broker
               but a direct dependency "mid-tier" package is not installed.
               Error message guides app developer to declare the correct dependency
               ``msal[broker]``.
               We error out here because the error is actionable to app developers.
            3. MSAL silently "deactivates" the broker and fallback to non-broker,
               when opted-in, dependency installed yet failed to initialize.
               We anticipate this would happen on a device whose OS is too old
               or the underlying broker component is somehow unavailable.
               There is not much an app developer or the end user can do here.
               Eventually, the conditional access policy shall
               force the user to switch to a different device.
            4. MSAL errors out when broker is opted in, installed, initialized,
               but subsequent token request(s) failed.
