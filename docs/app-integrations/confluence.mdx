This is the implementation of the Confluence app handler for MindsDB. It enables pulling the Confluence data to use it for model training.

[Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) is a collaborative tool for documentation, project collaboration, Jira integrations, and more.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using `atlassian-python-api`, a library that provides a simple and convenient way to interact with Atlassian products.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `url` is a Confluence-hosted URL instance.
* `confluence_api_token` is a token used to authenticate.

<Tip>
Please follow [this link](https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Content-Sources/Atlassian-Jira-Confluence-Authentication-Create-API-Token.htm) to generate the token for accessing the Confluence API.
</Tip>

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/confluence_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect the Confluence app to MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_confluence
WITH
    ENGINE = 'confluence',
    PARAMETERS = {
    "url": "https://wiki.onap.org/",
    "confluence_api_token": "MDk5NzgyNzY1Mzc3OlP5jEKnCL/z1+jIyEfIVIwERbJF"  
    };
```

It creates a database that comes with the `pages` table.

Now you can query your data, like this:

```sql
SELECT id, key, name, type
FROM mindsdb_confluence.pages
WHERE type = "personal"
ORDER BY id ASC, name DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
