This is the implementation of the Google Calendar app handler for MindsDB. It makes event data available to use for model training and predictions.

Google Calendar is a time-management and scheduling calendar service developed by Google.

## Implementation

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `credentials` is a path to the JSON file that stores credentials to the Google account.

<Tip>
Please note that a Google account with enabled Google Calendar is required. You can find more information [here](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python).
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect the Google Calendar app to MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_calendar
WITH
    ENGINE = 'google_calendar',
    PARAMETERS = {
        'credentials': '\path-to-your-file\credentials.json'
    }; 
```

It creates a database that comes with the `calendar` table.

Now you can use your Google Calendar data, like this:

* searching for events:

    ```sql
    SELECT id, created_at, author_username, text
    FROM my_calendar.calendar
    WHERE start_time > '2023-02-16'
    AND end_time < '2023-04-09' LIMIT 20;
    ```

* creating events:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO my_calendar.calendar (start_time, end_time, summary, description, location, attendees, reminders)
    VALUES ('2023-02-16 10:00:00', '2023-02-16 11:00:00', 'MindsDB Meeting', 'Discussing the future of MindsDB', 'MindsDB HQ', '');
    ```

* updating one or more events:

    ```sql
    UPDATE my_calendar.calendar
    SET summary     = 'MindsDB Meeting',
        description = 'Discussing the future of MindsDB',
        location    = 'MindsDB HQ',
        attendees   = '',
        reminders   = ''
    WHERE event_id > 1 AND event_id < 10;                   -- used to update events in a given range
    ```

* deleting one or more events:

    ```sql
    DELETE
    FROM my_calendar.calendar
    WHERE id = '1';
    ```
