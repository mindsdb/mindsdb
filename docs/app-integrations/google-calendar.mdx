This is the implementation of the Google Calendar app handler for MindsDB. It makes event data available to use for model training and predictions.

Google Calendar is a time-management and scheduling calendar service developed by Google.

## Connection

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `credentials_file` is a path to the JSON file that stores credentials to the Google account.

<Tip>
Please note that a Google account with enabled Google Calendar is required. You can find more information [here](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python).
</Tip>

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/google_calendar_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

In order to make use of this handler and connect the Google Calendar app to MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_calendar
WITH
    ENGINE = 'google_calendar',
    PARAMETERS = {
        'credentials_file': '\path-to-your-file\credentials.json'
    }; 
```
<Tip>
    
You need a Google account in order to use this integration. Here is how to get the credentials file:

1. Create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project:

    1.1 Go to the GCP Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    
    1.2 If you haven't created a project before, you'll be prompted to do so now.
    
    1.3 Give your new project a name.
    
    1.4 Click `Create` to create the new project.

2. Enable the Google Calendar API:

    2.1 In the GCP Console, select your project.

    2.2 Navigate to `APIs & Services` > `Library`.

    2.3 In the search bar, search for `Google Calendar API`.

    2.4 Click on ` Google Calendar API `, then click `Enable`.

3. Create credentials for the  Google Calendar API :

    3.1 Navigate to `APIs & Services` > `Credentials`.

    3.2 Click on the `Create Credentials` button and choose `OAuth client ID`.

    3.3 If you haven't configured the OAuth consent screen before, you'll be prompted to do so now. Make sure to choose `External` for User Type, and add all the necessary scopes. Make sure to save the changes.
    Now, create the OAuth client ID. Choose `Desktop app` for the Application Type and give it a name.

    3.4 Click `Create`.

4. Download the JSON file:

    4.1 After creating your credentials, click the download button (an icon of an arrow pointing down) on the right side of your client ID. This will download a JSON file, so you will use the location to it in the `credentials_file` param. 
</Tip>

## Usage

This creates a database that comes with the `calendar` table.

Now you can use your Google Calendar data, like this:

* searching for events:

    ```sql
    SELECT id, created_at, author_username, text
    FROM my_calendar.events
    WHERE start_time = '2023-02-16'
    AND end_time = '2023-04-09' LIMIT 20;
    ```

* creating events:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO my_calendar.events(start_time, end_time, summary, description, location, attendees, reminders, timeZone)
    VALUES ('2023-02-16 10:00:00', '2023-02-16 11:00:00', 'MindsDB Meeting', 'Discussing the future of MindsDB', 'MindsDB HQ', '', 'Europe/Athens');
    ```

* updating one or more events:

    ```sql
    UPDATE my_calendar.events
    SET summary     = 'MindsDB Meeting',
        description = 'Discussing the future of MindsDB',
        location    = 'MindsDB HQ',
        attendees   = '',
        reminders   = ''
    WHERE event_id > 1 AND event_id < 10;                   -- used to update events in a given range
    ```

* deleting one or more events:

    ```sql
    DELETE
    FROM my_calendar.events
    WHERE id = '1';
    ```
