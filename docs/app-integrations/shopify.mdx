This is the implementation of the Shopify app handler. It is responsible for fetching data from Shopify and utilizing it for training models and making predictions. Atm, it supports querying Products, Customers and Orders.

## Implementation

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

- `shop_url`: a required URL to your Shopify store.
- `access_token`: a required access token to use for authentication.

<Tip>
Here is how you can [create a Shopify access token](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f_aiC5oTNc&t=302s).

## Usage

To connect your Shopify account to MindsDB, you must first create a new handler instance. You can do it by the following query:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE shopify_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'shopify',
PARAMETERS = {
  "shop_url": "your-shop-name.myshopify.com",
  "access_token": "shppa_..."
};
```

Once you have created the database, you can query it like any other database. For example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM shopify_datasource.products
LIMIT 10;
```
Also, you can run more advanced queries and query the products or orders by status etc. For example:

```sql
SELECT  id, title
FROM shopify_datasource.products
WHERE status = 'active'
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 5
```
If you want to insert data into the store, run `INSERT INTO` statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO shopify_datasource.customers(first_name, last_name, email)
VALUES 
('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com')
```
