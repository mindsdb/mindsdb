Jupysql - full SQL client on Jupyter. It allows you to run SQL and plot large
datasets in Jupyter via a %sql and %%sql magics. It also allows users plotting
the data directly from the DB ( via %sqlplot magics).

Jupysql facilitates working with databases and Jupyter. You can download it
[here](https://github.com/ploomber/jupysql) or run a `pip install jupysql`.

<Tip>
You can consider an option to interact with MindsDB directly from [MySQL CLI](/connect/mysql-client/) or [Postgres CLI](/connect/postgres-client/).
</Tip>

## How to Connect

#### Pre-requisite:
- Make sure you have *jupysql* installed: To install it, run `pip install jupysql`
- Make sure you have *pymysql* installed: To install it, run `pip install pymysql`

<Note>
  You can easily verify the installation of jupysql by running this code:

  ```python
  %load_ext sql
  ```

  This command loads the package and allows you to run cell magics on top of Jupyter.

  And for pymysql, validate by running this command:

  ```python
  import pymysql
  ```
</Note>

Please follow the instructions below to connect into your MindsDB via Jupysql and Jupyter.

<Tabs>
        <Tab title="Local MindsDB">
        You can use the Python code below to connect your Jupyter notebook (or lab) to Local MindsDB database (via Jupysql).
        Load the extension:

        ```python
        %load_ext sql
        ```

        Connect to your DB:

        ```python
        %sql mysql+pymysql://mindsdb:@127.0.0.1:47335/mindsdb
        ```

        Testing connection by listing the existing tables (pure SQL):

        ```python
        %sql show tables
        ```

        Please note that we use the following connection details:

        - Username is `mindsdb`
        - Password is left empty
        - Host is `127.0.0.1`
        - Port is `47335`
        - Database name is `mindsdb`

        *Docker* - connecting to docker might have a different port.

        </Tab>
        <Tab title="MindsDB Cloud">
        You can use the Python code below to connect your Jupyter notebook (or lab) to Cloud MindsDB database (via Jupysql).

        Load the extension:

        ```python
        %load_ext sql
        ```

        Connect to your DB:
        *Make sure* to update the user and password in the connection string.
        user - your Mindsdb Cloud email address is your username
        ```python
        %sql mysql+pymysql://<mindsdb_user>:<mindsdb_pass>@cloud.mindsdb.com:3306/mindsdb
        ```

        Testing connection by listing the existing tables (pure SQL):

        ```python
        %sql show tables
        ```

        Please note that we use the following connection details:

        - Username is your MindsDB Cloud email address
        - Password is your MindsDB Cloud password
        - Host is `cloud.mindsdb.com`
        - Port is `3306`
        - Database name is `mindsdb`

        </Tab>
        <Tab title="MindsDB Pro">
        You can use the Python code below to connect your Jupyter notebook (or lab) to MindsDB Pro account (via Jupysql).

        Load the extension:

        ```python
        %load_ext sql
        ```

        Connect to your DB:
        *Make sure* to update the user and password in the connection string.
        user - your Mindsdb Cloud email address is your username
        ```python
        %sql mysql+pymysql://<mindsdb_user>:<mindsdb_pass>@<dedicated instace ip>:3306/mindsdb
        ```

        Testing connection by listing the existing tables (pure SQL):

        ```python
        %sql show tables
        ```

        Please note that we use the following connection details:

        - Username is your MindsDB Cloud email address
        - Password is your MindsDB Cloud password
        - Host is the IP address of your dedicated instace
        - Port is `3306`
        - Database name is `mindsdb`

        </Tab>
</Tabs>

Create a database connection and execute the code above. On success, only the last command which lists the tables will output. The expected output is:

```bash
*  mysql+pymysql://mindsdb:***@127.0.0.1:47335/mindsdb
2 rows affected.
Tables_in_mindsdb
models
models_versions
```

Now that you are all set, we recommend you check out our **Tutorials** and
**Community Tutorials** sections, where you'll find various examples of
regression, classification, and time series predictions with MindsDB.

To learn more about MindsDB itself, follow the guide on
[MindsDB database structure](/sql/table-structure/). Also, don't miss out on the
remaining pages from the **SQL API** section, as they explain a common SQL
syntax with examples.

Have fun!
