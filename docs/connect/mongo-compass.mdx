Let's go through the steps presented above:

1. We connect MongoDB Compass to MindsDB. It is discussed in the following content.

2. We connect MindsDB to a database. You can use the [`CREATE DATABASE`](/sql/create/databases) statement and run it from MindsDB, passing all required database connection details.

3. Having completed steps 1 and 2, you can access the connected database from MongoDB Compass via MindsDB.
