MongoDB Shell is the quickest way to connect and work with MongoDB.

MindsDB provides a powerful MongoDB API, allowing users to connect MindsDB to the [MongoDB Shell](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell). Please note that connection to MongoDB API provided by MindsDB is the same as connection to a MongoDB database. You can download MongoDB Shell [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell).

## Overview

Here is an overview of the connection between MindsDB and MongoDB Shell:

</p>

Let's go through the steps presented above:

1. We connect MongoDB Shell to MindsDB. It is discussed in the following content.

2. We connect MindsDB to a database. You can use the [`CREATE DATABASE`](/sql/create/databases) statement and run it from MindsDB, passing all required database connection details.

3. Having completed steps 1 and 2, you can access the connected database from MongoDB Shell via MindsDB.

## How to Connect

Here is how to connect MongoDB Shell to MindsDB using either MindsDB Cloud or local installation.

<Info>
Please add the [MindsDB Cloud Public IPs](/faqs/whitelist-ips) to the access list of your Mongo database.

Let's look at the connection strings for both MindsDB Cloud and local installation.

<Tabs>

  <Tab title= "Local MindsDB">
  
    Provide your local MindsDB connection string to connect to a local MindsDB installation. You can copy the connection string from the MongoDB Compass if you have already created a connection there.

    Here is a connection string to connect to a local MindsDB installation:

    ```bash
    mongodb://127.0.0.1:47336/
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="MindsDB Cloud">

    Here is a connection string to connect to the MindsDB Cloud account. You can copy the connection string from the MongoDB Compass if you have already created a connection there.

    ```bash
    mongodb://mindsdb_cloud_username:mindsdb_cloud_password@cloud.mindsdb.com:27017/?authMechanism=DEFAULT
    ```

    Please replace the `mindsdb_cloud_username` placeholder with your MindsDB Cloud account email. Also, replace the `mindsdb_cloud_password` placeholder with your MindsDB Cloud password. The host value is `cloud.mindsdb.com` and the port value is `27017`. We use the default authentication mechanism.

    Let's look at an example:

    <p align="center">
      <img src="/assets/connect_mongo_shell_2.png" />
    </p>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="MindsDB Pro">

    Here is a connection string to connect to the MindsDB Pro account. You can copy the connection string from the MongoDB Compass if you have already created a connection there.

    ```bash
    mongodb://mindsdb_cloud_username:mindsdb_cloud_password@<dedicated instance ip>:3306/?authMechanism=DEFAULT
    ```

    It is similar to connecting MindsDB Cloud. Please replace the `mindsdb_cloud_username` placeholder with your MindsDB Cloud account email. Also, replace the `mindsdb_cloud_password` placeholder with your MindsDB Cloud password. The host value is the IP address of your dedicated instance and the port value is 3306. We use the default authentication mechanism.
