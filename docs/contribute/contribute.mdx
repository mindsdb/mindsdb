## MindsDB Release Process

The `main` branch of the [MindsDB repository](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb) contains the latest stable version of MindsDB and represents the GA (General Availability) release. Learn more about [MindsDB release types here](/releases).

MindsDB follows the [Gitflow branching model](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) to manage development and releases as follows.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Development Phase">
    All code changes are first committed to the `develop` branch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Release Preparation">
    When a release is approaching, a short-lived `release` branch is created from the `develop` branch.
      * This branch is used for final testing and validation.
      * Pre-GA artifacts are built at this stage, including both the Python package and the Docker image, and shared for broader testing and feedback.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Release Finalization">
    After successful testing and validation:
      * The `release` branch is merged into the `main` branch, making it an official GA release.
      * The final GA versions of the Python package and Docker image are released, while the pre-GA version are removed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Contributor Testing Requirements

As a contributor, you are responsible for writing the code according to the [Python Coding Standards](/contribute/python-coding-standards) and thoroughly testing all features or fixes that you implement before they are merged into the `develop` branch.

### Feature Branch Testing

Before merging your changes, the following types of testing must be completed to validate your work in isolation:

* Unit Tests
Verify that individual components or functions behave as expected during development.

* Integration Tests
Ensure that your new code works correctly with existing functionality and doesn't introduce regressions.

### Post-Release Testing

After a release that includes your features or fixes is published, contributors are encouraged to:

* Test their changes in the released environment, and
* Report any issues or unexpected behavior that may arise.
