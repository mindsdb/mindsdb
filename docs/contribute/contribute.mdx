## Contributor Testing Requirements

As a contributor, you are responsible for writing the code according to the [Python Coding Standards](/contribute/python-coding-standards) and thoroughly testing all features or fixes that you implement before they are merged into the `develop` branch.

### Feature Branch Testing

Before merging your changes, the following types of testing must be completed to validate your work in isolation:

* Unit Tests
Verify that individual components or functions behave as expected during development.

* Integration Tests
Ensure that your new code works correctly with existing functionality and doesn't introduce regressions.

### Post-Release Testing

After a release that includes your features or fixes is published, contributors are encouraged to:

* Test their changes in the released environment, and
* Report any issues or unexpected behavior that may arise.
