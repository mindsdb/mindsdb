Currently, all the supported data integrations are listed [here](/data-integrations/all-data-integrations).

We plan to provide extensive instructions on how to connect and use each of the data integrations. Thus, each data integration requires its dedicated doc page.

Please follow the steps below to create a dedicated doc page for your chosen data integration.

## Step 1. Create a File

Create a [Markdown file](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) under the `mindsdb/docs/data-integrations` directory and name it with the database name.

<Tip>
If you implement a doc page for the Amazon Redshift database, name the file as `amazon-redshift.mdx`.
</Tip>

## Step 2. Implement the Content

Please include the following at the beginning of the file:

```sql
---
title: <INPUT DATA INTEGRATION NAME HERE>
sidebarTitle: <INPUT DATA INTEGRATION NAME HERE>
---

<ADD YOUR CONTENT HERE FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW>
```

<Tip>
Here is a sample for the Oracle data integration:

```sql
---
title: Oracle
sidebarTitle: Oracle
---

<ADD YOUR CONTENT HERE FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW>
```
</Tip>

Here are the resources you should use to implement the content of the doc page:

- Use the connection template and example from [here](/data-integrations/all-data-integrations).

    <Tip>
    If you implement a doc page for the Google BigQuery database, use [this chapter](/data-integrations/all-data-integrations#google-bigquery).
    </Tip>

- Check out the dedicated handler folder [here](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/tree/staging/mindsdb/integrations/handlers). Pay attention to the `README.md` file, as it contains valuable information that should be included in the doc page.

    <Tip>
    If you implement a doc page for the Google BigQuery database, go to [its handler folder here](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/tree/staging/mindsdb/integrations/handlers/bigquery_handler) and see the [`README.md` file here](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/staging/mindsdb/integrations/handlers/bigquery_handler/README.md).
    </Tip>

You are welcome to provide usage examples of the data integrations in MindsDB!
