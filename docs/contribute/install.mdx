If you want to contribute to the development of MindsDB, you need to install
it first.

There are a few installation options that you can choose as follows:

- from [source](/setup/self-hosted/pip/source/),
- using PyPi for [Windows](/setup/self-hosted/pip/windows/),
  [Linux](/setup/self-hosted/pip/linux/), or
  [MacOS](/setup/self-hosted/pip/macos/),
- using [Docker image](/setup/self-hosted/docker/).

Our preferred MindsDB installation method for development is the installation
from source.

## Installing MindsDB

Here, we recall the steps of MindsDB installation from source. You can either
follow the steps below or visit the provided link.

Before proceeding, make sure you have `Git` and `Python 3.8.x` or `Python 3.9.x`
installed.

1. Fork the MindsDB repository from
   [GitHub](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/fork).

2. Clone the fork locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/mindsdb.git
```

3. Create a new virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv mindsdb-venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source mindsdb-venv/bin/activate
```

5. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd mindsdb && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Install MindsDB:

```bash
python setup.py develop
```

7. Start MindsDB:

```bash
python -m mindsdb
```

If everything works as expected, you should see the following message in the
console:

**Community Tutorials** sections, where you'll find various examples of
regression, classification, and time series predictions with MindsDB.

To learn more about MindsDB itself, follow the guide on
[MindsDB database structure](/sql/table-structure/). Also, don't miss out on the
remaining pages from the **SQL API** section, as they explain a common SQL
