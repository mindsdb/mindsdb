# Loan Default Prediction

## Introduction

A loan refers to is money borrowed by someone (the *debtor*) with the intent to pay it back at an agreed date. Ideally, things should go as planned but when the debtor fails to pay the person they borrowed the loan from (the *creditor*), the debtor is said to have defaulted on the loan. This scenario is referrer to **Loan defaulting**, i.e, the event of the debtor not repaying their loan amount.  


It is hence important for creditors/loan companies to know/predict if a certain debtor will default or not. This is a problem that machine learning solves, this is a classification machine learning problem.

As with every machine learning problem, data is the major ingredient to solving it. The [dataset](https://zindi.africa/competitions/data-science-nigeria-challenge-1-loan-default-prediction/data) for this problem is from the [Zindi](https://zindi.africa) [Loan Default Prediction Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/data-science-nigeria-challenge-1-loan-default-prediction) for [DSN](https://www.datasciencenigeria.org/).

This tutorial is to showcase how [MindsDB](https://docs.mindsdb.com) can be used to solve this problem. We will explore how you can use a machine learning model to classify positive and negative cases in predicting loan default. MindsDB allows you to train your model from a .CSV format directly, and we will:

- Load your dataset; 
- Create a predictor; and
- Make predictions

## Load your dataset
### Data wrangling

If you go through the dataset, you will find that it is split into three different files. You will first wrangle the data to suit your requirements.  

Here, we use python to wrangle the data, you can however use your desired tool (like Excel).

```
# code snippet to join data

# import dependencies and read in data files
import pandas as pd 
import functools as ft

trainPerf = pd.read_csv('trainperf.csv')
trainDemographics = pd.read_csv('traindemographics.csv')

# join data together, clean and write to .csv

data = trainPerf.merge(trainDemographics, left_on='customerid', right_on='customerid')
data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
data.dropna(axis=1, inplace=True)
data.drop(['customerid', 'systemloanid'], axis=1, inplace=True) # remove id columns
data.to_csv('loanData.csv')
```

Now that the dataset has been cleaned and stored into a .csv file, you can upload it to MindsDB cloud.

### Using the MindsDB GUI

To use the MindsDB GUI, you will need to access the [MindsDB cloud tool](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/) and sign up for an account if you haven't yet, and you will be automatically directed to the editor.

While on the editor, you can [add your data](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/data) via several means, but as earlier mentioned, you will upload your dataset as a .csv.

On the "Select your data source" screen, click on "Files" next to "Databases" and you should see the screen below:

![import your file](mindsdb/docs/mindsdb-docs/docs/contribute/tutorials/screen1.png)

Click on the "Import File" icon and select your .csv file. 

Give your table a name and hit the "Save and Continue" button. **NOTE: Use snake or camel casing when uploading files**

If you do all things well, you should see a result like this:

Now that you have loaded your dataset, you can now...

## Create a Predictor
Creating a predictor in MindsDB is as easy as four lines of code. Copy and paste the code below into your SQL editor to make a predictor

```
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.loanPredictor
FROM files (
    SELECT * FROM files.loanData
) PREDICT good_bad_flag;
```

If everything works as intended, you should see this screen below:

![Query successfully completed](mindsdb/docs/mindsdb-docs/docs/contribute/tutorials/screen3.png)

To confirm this and view details of your model like the accuracy, use the following code:

```
DESCRIBE loanPredictor;
```

and you can see details of your model.

**PS: You can see the accuracy is low, this is probably due to low data...**

Now that you have created your predictor model, now it is time to...

## Make a prediction

You can use the following query to make a prediction:  
**PS: Pay attention to highlight your prediction query and run it**

```
SELECT good_bad_flag
FROM mindsdb.loanPredictor
WHERE loannumber=1 AND approveddate='2022-07-04 10:12:66.000000' AND
creationdate='2022-07-04 08:10:00.000000' AND loanamount=100000 AND
totaldue=110000 AND termdays=30 AND birthdate='1986-11-04 00:00:00.000000' AND
bank_account_type='Savings' AND longitude_gps=3.3269784 AND latitude_gps=5.799699 AND
bank_name_clients='UBA';
```

And viola! You just made a prediction!

## Conclusion
And that's it, you shining rockstar! You are now an ML Wizard making predictions straight from the data! This is a taste of the awesome power of MindsDB.
Some important things to note:

- More data improves the accuracy of the model
- Your table names should not contain spaces but should rather be in snake or camel casing
- Highlight your prediction query and run it to see result
- MindsDB is fast and very helpful
