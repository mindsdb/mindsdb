In this section, you'll find how to create new machine learning (ML) handlers within MindsDB.

<Note>
    **Prerequisite**

    You should have the latest staging version of the MindsDB repository installed locally. Follow [this guide](/contribute/install/) to learn how to install MindsDB for development.

## What are Machine Learning Handlers?

ML handlers act as a bridge to any ML framework. You use ML handlers to create ML engines using [the CREATE ML_ENGINE command](/sql/create/ml-engine/). So you can expose ML models from any supported ML engine as an AI table.

    **Database Handlers**

## Creating a Machine Learning Handler

You can create your own ML handler within MindsDB by inheriting from the [BaseMLEngine](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/3d9090acb0b8b3b0e2a96e2c93dad436f5ebef90/mindsdb/integrations/libs/base.py#L123) class.

By providing the implementation for some or all of the methods contained in the `BaseMLEngine` class, you can connect with the machine learning library or framework of your choice.

### Core Methods

Apart from the `__init__()` method, there are five methods, of which two must be implemented. We recommend checking actual examples in the codebase to get an idea of what goes into each of these methods, as they can change a bit depending on the nature of the system being integrated.

Let's review the purpose of each method.

| Method            | Purpose                                                                              |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `create()`        | It creates a model inside the engine registry.                                       |
| `predict()`       | It calls a model and returns prediction data.                                        |
| `update()`        | Optional. It updates an existing model without resetting its internal structure.     |
| `describe()`      | Optional. It provides global model insights.                                         |
| `create_engine()` | Optional. It connects with external sources, such as REST API.                       |

Authors can opt for adding private methods, new files and folders, or any combination of these to structure all the necessary work that will enable the core methods to work as intended.

<Tip>
    **Other Common Methods**
    
    Under the `mindsdb.integrations.libs.utils` library, contributors can find various methods that may be useful while implementing new handlers.

    Also, there is a wrapper class for the `BaseMLEngine` instances called [BaseMLEngineExec](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/staging/mindsdb/integrations/libs/ml_exec_base.py#L157). It is automatically deployed to take care of modifying the data responses into something that can be used alongside data handlers.

### Implementation

Here are the methods that must be implemented while inheriting from the [BaseMLEngine](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/3d9090acb0b8b3b0e2a96e2c93dad436f5ebef90/mindsdb/integrations/libs/base.py#L123) class:

* [The create() method](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/3d9090acb0b8b3b0e2a96e2c93dad436f5ebef90/mindsdb/integrations/libs/base.py#L151) saves a model inside the engine registry for later usage.

```py
def create(self, target: str, df: Optional[pd.DataFrame] = None, args: Optional[Dict] = None) -> None:
        """
        Saves a model inside the engine registry for later usage.
        Normally, an input dataframe is required to train the model.
        However, some integrations may merely require registering the model instead of training, in which case `df` can be omitted.
        Any other arguments required to register the model can be passed in an `args` dictionary.
        """
```

* [The predict() method](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/3d9090acb0b8b3b0e2a96e2c93dad436f5ebef90/mindsdb/integrations/libs/base.py#L162) calls a model with an input dataframe and optionally, arguments to modify model's behaviour. This method returns a dataframe with the predicted values.

```py
def predict(self, df: pd.DataFrame, args: Optional[Dict] = None) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """
        Calls a model with some input dataframe `df`, and optionally some arguments `args` that may modify the model behavior.
        The expected output is a dataframe with the predicted values in the target-named column.
        Additional columns can be present, and will be considered row-wise explanations if their names finish with `_explain`.
        """
```

And here are the optional methods that you can implement alongside the mandatory ones if your ML framework allows it:

* [The update() method](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/3d9090acb0b8b3b0e2a96e2c93dad436f5ebef90/mindsdb/integrations/libs/base.py#L171) is used to update, fine-tune, or adjust an existing model without resetting its internal state.

```py
def update(self, df: Optional[pd.DataFrame] = None, args: Optional[Dict] = None) -> None:
        """
        Optional.
        Used to update/fine-tune/adjust a pre-existing model without resetting its internal state (e.g. weights).
        Availability will depend on underlying integration support, as not all ML models can be partially updated.
        """
```

* [The describe() method](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/3d9090acb0b8b3b0e2a96e2c93dad436f5ebef90/mindsdb/integrations/libs/base.py#L181) provides global model insights, such as framework-level parameters used in training.

```py
def describe(self, key: Optional[str] = None) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """
        Optional.
        When called, this method provides global model insights, e.g. framework-level parameters used in training.
        """
```

* [The create_engine() method](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/3d9090acb0b8b3b0e2a96e2c93dad436f5ebef90/mindsdb/integrations/libs/base.py#L189) is used to connect with the external sources, such as REST API.

```py
def create_engine(self, connection_args: dict):
        """
        Optional.
        Used to connect with external sources (e.g. a REST API) that the engine will require to use any other methods.
        """
```
