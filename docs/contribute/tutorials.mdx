This section presents how to write a tutorial with MindsDB.

<Info> 
**Content of the Tutorial**

You are free to create your content. However, you should include in your tutorial all the chapters listed here.

The tutorial should be a Markdown file, for example, `mindsdb-tutorial.mdx`. Here is the [basic Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
</Info>

## Introduction

Here you introduce the readers to the tutorial. You can describe what dataset
you use and what you predict.

## Data Setup

This chapter contains an introduction to the dataset you use.

### Connecting the Data

Let others follow your tutorial by providing information on where to get the
data from and how to connect it to MindsDB.

### Understanding the Data

You can briefly introduce the dataset you use.

## Training a Predictor

Here you use the [`CREATE MODEL`](/sql/create/model/) command to create
a predictor.

## Status of a Predictor

The next step is to check the status of a predictor. If its value is `complete`,
you can proceed to the next chapter.

## Making Predictions

Use the [`SELECT`](/sql/api/select/) statement to query for prediction results.
It is good to present the output to the readers.

### Making a Single Prediction

In the case of regression and classification predictors, you can make a single
prediction. It is good to present the output to the readers.

### Making Batch Predictions

You can make batch predictions using the [`JOIN`](/sql/api/join/) clause for all
predictor types, such as regression, classification, and time series. It is good
to present the output to the readers.

tutorial in the MindsDB docs!
