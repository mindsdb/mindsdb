This is the implementation of the PostgreSQL handler for MindsDB.

## PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.

## Syntax

MindsDB lets you connect to your favorite databases, data warehouses, data lakes, etc., via the CREATE DATABASE command.

The MindsDB SQL API supports creating connections to integrations by passing the connection parameters specific per integration.

Let’s review the syntax for the CREATE DATABASE command of PostgreSQL.

```sql

CREATE DATABASE psql_datasource         --- display name for the database
WITH ENGINE = 'postgres',               --- name of the MindsDB handler
PARAMETERS = {
  "host": " ",                          --- host name or IP address
  "port": ,                             --- port used to make TCP/IP connection
  "database": " ",                      --- database name
  "user": " ",                          --- database user
  "password": " "                       --- database password
};

```

## Example

```sql

CREATE DATABASE example_db
WITH ENGINE = "postgres",
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "demo_user",
    "password": "demo_password",
    "host": "3.220.66.106",
    "port": "5432",
    "database": "demo"
};



```

Here we connect the **example_db** database, which is a PostgreSQL database.

## Querying

To run PostgreSQL-native code, we must nest it within the SELECT statement like this:

```sql

SELECT * FROM example_db (
    SELECT 
        model, 
        year, 
        price, 
        transmission, 
        mileage, 
        fueltype, 
        mpg, -- miles per galon
        ROUND(CAST((mpg / 2.3521458) AS numeric), 1) AS kml, -- kilometers per liter
        (date_part('year', CURRENT_DATE)-year) AS years_old, -- age of a car
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY model, year) AS units_to_sell, -- how many units of a certain model are sold in a year
        ROUND((CAST(tax AS decimal) / price), 3) AS tax_div_price -- value of tax divided by price of a car
    FROM demo_data.used_car_price
);

```
On execution, we get:
```
+-----+----+-----+------------+-------+--------+----+----+---------+-------------+-------------+
|model|year|price|transmission|mileage|fueltype|mpg |kml |years_old|units_to_sell|tax_div_price|
+-----+----+-----+------------+-------+--------+----+----+---------+-------------+-------------+
| A1  |2010|9990 |Automatic   |38000  |Petrol  |53.3|22.7|12       |1            |0.013        |
| A1  |2011|6995 |Manual      |65000  |Petrol  |53.3|22.7|11       |5            |0.018        |
| A1  |2011|6295 |Manual      |107000 |Petrol  |53.3|22.7|11       |5            |0.02         |
| A1  |2011|4250 |Manual      |116000 |Diesel  |70.6|30  |11       |5            |0.005        |
| A1  |2011|6475 |Manual      |45000  |Diesel  |70.6|30  |11       |5            |0            |
+-----+----+-----+------------+-------+--------+----+----+---------+-------------+-------------+
```

The first line (SELECT * FROM example_db) informs MindsDB that we select from a PostgreSQL database. After that, we nest a PostgreSQL code within brackets.
