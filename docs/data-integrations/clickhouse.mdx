This is the implementation of the ClickHouse data handler for MindsDB.

[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/intro/) is a column-oriented database management system (DBMS) for online analytical processing of queries (OLAP).

## Implementation

This handler was implemented using the standard `clickhouse-sqlalchemy` library.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `host` is the host name or IP address of the ClickHouse server.
* `port` is the TCP/IP port of the ClickHouse server.
* `user` is the username used to authenticate with the ClickHouse server.
* `password` is the password to authenticate the user with the ClickHouse server.
* `database` defaults to `default`. It is the database name to use when connecting with the ClickHouse server.
* `protocol` defaults to `native`. It is an optional parameters. Its supported values are `http` and `https`.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/clickhouse_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the ClickHouse database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE clickhouse_datasource
WITH
    engine = 'clickhouse',
    parameters = {
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": "9000",
      "user": "root",
      "password": "password",
      "database": "test_db"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM clickhouse_datasource.example_table;
```

<Tip>
If you want to swithc to different database instead the one you have connected, you can include it in the query as:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM clickhouse_datasource.new_database.example_table;
```
