# DB2 Handler

This is the implementation of the IBM DB2 handler for MindsDB.

## IBM DB2
DB2 is a database product from IBM. It is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). DB2 is designed to store, analyze and retrieve the data efficiently. DB2 product is extended with the support of Object-Oriented features and non-relational structures with XML. Overall, DB2 is a reliable and adaptable database management system that can be used in a variety of applications and industries. It is recognized for its dependability, scalability, and cutting-edge features.

## Implementation
This handler was implemented using the `ibm_db/ibm_db_dbi`, a Python library that allows you to use Python code to run SQL commands on DB2 Database.


The required arguments to establish a connection are:

| Name                                  | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user`                            |  This is the username asscociated with the database.
| `password`                                |  This is the password required to authenticate your access to the database. |
| `host`                                |  This is the host to server IP Address or hostname.                                                  |
| `port`                                |  This is the port through which TCP/IP connection is to be made.                              |
| `database`                            |  This is the database name to be connected.                          |
| `schema`                            |  Schema name required to get the tables

## Usage
A text example of usage of this handler and connect to DB2 in MindsDB can be seen below,

~~~~sql
CREATE DATABASE DB2_datasource
WITH
engine='DB2',
parameters={
    "user":"db2admin",
    "password":"1234",
    "host":"127.0.0.1",
    "port":25000,
    "schema_name":"db2admin",
    "database":"BOOKS"
};
~~~~

Now, you can use this established connection to query your database as follows,
~~~~sql
SELECT * FROM DB2_datasource.AUTHORS;
~~~~
