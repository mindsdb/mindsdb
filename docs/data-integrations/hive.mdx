## Hive

Apache Hive is a data warehouse software project built on top of Apache Hadoop for providing data query and analysis. Hive gives an SQL-like interface to query data stored in various databases and file systems that integrate with Hadoop.

## Implementation
This handler is implemented using the `pyHive`, a Python library that allows you to use Python code to run SQL commands on Hive.

The required arguments to establish a connection are:

* `user`: username asscociated with database
* `password`: password to authenticate your access
* `host`: host to server IP Address or hostname
* `port`: port through which TCPIP connection is to be made
* `database`: Database name to be connected
* `auth`: Defaults to CUSTOM in case not provided. Check for other options in [https://pypi.org/project/PyHive/](https://pypi.org/project/PyHive/)


## Usage
In order to make use of this handler and connect to Hive in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE hive_datasource   --- display name for the database
WITH ENGINE = 'hive',             --- name of the MindsDB handler
PARAMETERS = {
  "user": " ",                    --- database user
  "password": " ",                --- database password
  "host": " ",                    --- host name or IP address
  "port": ,                       --- port used to make TCP/IP connection
  "database": " ",                --- database name
  "auth": " "                     --- defaults to CUSTOM if not provided; check for options here: https://pypi.org/project/PyHive/
};
```

Now, you can use this established connection to query your database as follows,

```sql
SELECT * FROM hive_datasource.table_name;
```
