This is the implementation of the SurrealDB data handler for MindsDB.

[SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/) is an innovative NewSQL cloud database, suitable for serverless applications, jamstack applications, single-page applications, and traditional applications.

## Implementation

This handler was implemented by using the python library `pysurrealdb`.

The required arguments to establish a connection are:

* `host`: the host name of the Surrealdb connection
* `port`: the port to use when connecting
* `user`: the user to authenticate
* `password`: the password to authenticate the user
* `database`: database name to be connected
* `namespace`: namespace name to be connected

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/surrealdb_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

To establish a connection with our SurrealDB server which is running locally with the public cloud instance. We are going to use `ngrok tunneling` to connect cloud instance to the local SurrealDB server. You can follow this [guide](https://docs.mindsdb.com/sql/create/database#making-your-local-database-available-to-mindsdb) for that.

Let's make the connection with the MindsDB public cloud 

```sql
CREATE DATABASE exampledb
WITH ENGINE = 'surrealdb',
PARAMETERS = {
  "host": "6.tcp.ngrok.io",
  "port": "17141",
  "user": "root",
  "password": "root",
  "database": "testdb",
  "namespace": "testns"
};
```

Please change the `host` and `port` properties in the `PARAMETERS` clause based on the values which you got.

We can also query the `dev` table which we created with
```sql
SELECT * FROM exampledb.dev;
```
