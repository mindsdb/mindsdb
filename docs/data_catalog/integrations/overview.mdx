As of now, the Data Catalog is available for the following integrations:

- [Snowflake](/integrations/data-integrations/snowflake)
- [Salesforce](/integrations/app-integrations/salesforce)
- [BigQuery](/integrations/data-integrations/google-bigquery)
- [MS SQL Server](/integrations/data-integrations/microsoft-sql-server)
- [MySQL](/integrations/app-integrations/mysql)
- [Oracle](/integrations/data-integrations/oracle)
- [PostgreSQL](/integrations/data-integrations/postgresql)

### Enabling the Data Catalog

To enable the Data Catalog feature in MindsDB, update your `config.json` file by setting the `data_catalog` flag to `true`:

```json
{
    "data_catalog": {
        "enabled": true
    }
}
```

Follow this doc page to learn how to [start MindsDB with custom configuration](/setup/custom-config).

<Note>
Note that the data catalog is generated for a data source only after this data source is connected to an agent.

Here is an example:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE snowflake_data
WITH
    ENGINE = 'snowflake',
    PARAMETERS = {
        "account": "abc123-xyz987",
        "user": "username",
        "password": "password",
        "database": "database_name",
        "schema": "schema_name",
        "warehouse": "warehouse_name"
    };

CREATE AGENT my_agent
USING
    include_tables= ['snowflake_data.table_name', ...];
```

Now you can [query the data catalog](/data_catalog/integrations/query) generated for the `snowflake_data` integration.
</Note>

### How It Works

When you create an [agent](/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent) in MindsDB that connects to one of the supported integrations, the Data Catalog automatically:

1. Inspects the data source.
2. Extracts metadata for all accessible tables and columns.
3. Stores this information in a dedicated catalog schema (`DATA_CATALOG`).
4. Makes this metadata available to agents and users via both SQL queries and internal reasoning.

<Warning>
**Current Limitations**

This feature is still evolving and has some known limitations:

- **One-Time Snapshot**: Metadata is generated only once—at the time the agent is created. If the data schema changes (e.g., new columns, renamed tables), the Data Catalog will not automatically update. A refresh mechanism is planned in a future release.
- **No Manual Feedback**: If any metadata appears to be incorrect (e.g., wrong row counts or data types), there is currently no way for users to flag or correct it. A feedback system will be introduced soon.
</Warning>
