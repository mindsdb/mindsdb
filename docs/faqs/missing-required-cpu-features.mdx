Depending on the operating system and its setup, you may encounter this runtime warning when starting MindsDB:

```bash
RuntimeWarning: Missing required CPU features.
The following required CPU features were not detected:
avx2, fma, bmi1, bmi2, lzcnt
```

The solution is to install the `polars-lts-cpu` package in the environment where MindsDB runs.
