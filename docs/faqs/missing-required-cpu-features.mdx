Depending on the operating system and its setup, you may encounter this runtime warning when starting MindsDB:

```bash
RuntimeWarning: Missing required CPU features.
The following required CPU features were not detected:
avx2, fma, bmi1, bmi2, lzcnt
```

The solution is to install the `polars-lts-cpu` package in the environment where MindsDB runs.

If you are on an Apple ARM machine (e.g. M1), this warning is likely due to running Python under Rosetta. To troubleshoot it, install a native version of Python that does not run under Rosetta x86-64 emulation.
