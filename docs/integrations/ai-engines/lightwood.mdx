Lightwood is the default AI engine used in MindsDB. It deals mainly with [classification](/sql/tutorials/customer-churn), [regression](/sql/tutorials/home-rentals), and [time-series](/sql/tutorials/house-sales-forecasting) problems in machine learning.

By providing it with the input data and problem definition, Lightwood generates predictions following three core steps that include *Data pre-processing and cleaning*, *Feature engineering*, and *Model building and training*. The input data ranges from numbers, dates, categories, text, quantities, arrays, matrices, up to images, audios, and videos (passed as URLs).

## How It Works

Here is the algorithm followed by Lightwood starting from the input data setup, through model building and training, up to getting predictions.

</p>

The input data is pre-processed and each column is assigned a data type. Next, data is converted into features via *encoders* that transform data into numerical representation used by the model. Finally, a predictive model takes the encoded feature data and outputs a prediction for the target.

Under the hood, the model splits data into the training, validation, and testing sets, with ratios that are dynamic but usually an 80-10-10 ratio. The split is done by default using random sampling without replacement, stratified on the target column. Doing so, it determines the accuracy of the model by evaluating on the held out test set.

Users can either use [Lightwood’s default mixers/models](/integrations/ai-engines/lightwood#model-key) or create their own approaches inherited from the `BaseMixer` class.

## Accuracy Metrics

Lightwood provides ways to score the accuracy of the model using one of the accuracy functions.

The accuracy functions include `mean_absolute_error`, `mean_squared_error`, `precision_score`, `recall_score`, and `f1_score`.

```sql
CREATE MODEL model_name
FROM data_source
  (SELECT * FROM table_name)
PREDICT target_column
USING
  accuracy_functions="['accuracy_function']";
```

You can define the accuracy function of choice in the `USING` clause of the `CREATE MODEL` statement.

<Note>
Here are the accuracy functions used by default:

- the `r2_score` value for regression predictions.
- the `balanced_accuracy_score` value for classification predictions.
- the `complementary_smape_array_accuracy` value for time series predictions.

The values vary between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a perfect predictor, based on results obtained for a held-out portion of data (i.e. testing set).

You can check accuracy values for models using the [`DESCRIBE`](/sql/api/describe) statement.

## Tuning the Lightwood ML Engine

### Description

In MindsDB, the underlying AutoML models are based on the [Lightwood](https://mindsdb.github.io/lightwood/index.html) engine by default. This library generates models automatically based on the data and declarative problem definition. But the default configuration can be overridden using the `USING` statement that provides an option to configure specific parameters of the training process.

In the upcoming version of MindsDB, it will be possible to choose from more ML frameworks. Please note that the Lightwood engine is used by default.

### Syntax

Here is the syntax:

```sql
CREATE MODEL project_name.model_name
FROM data_source
    (SELECT column_name, ... FROM table_name)
PREDICT target_column
USING parameter_key = 'parameter_value';
```

#### `encoders` Key

It grants access to configure how each column is encoded. By default, the AutoML engine tries to get the best match for the data.

```sql
...
USING encoders.column_name.module = 'value';
```

To learn more about `encoders` and their options, visit the [Lightwood documentation page on encoders](https://mindsdb.github.io/lightwood/encoder.html).

#### `model` Key

It allows you to specify the type of machine learning algorithm to learn from the encoder data.

```sql
...
USING model.args = {"key": value};
```

Here are the model options:

| Model                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

#### Other Keys Supported by Lightwood in JsonAI

The most common use cases of configuring predictors use `encoders` and `model` keys explained above. To see all the available keys, check out the [Lightwood documentation page on JsonAI](https://mindsdb.github.io/lightwood/api/types.html#api.types.JsonAI).

### Example

Here we use the `home_rentals` dataset and specify particular `encoders` for some columns and a LightGBM `model`.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.home_rentals_model
FROM example_db
    (SELECT * FROM demo_data.home_rentals)
PREDICT rental_price
USING
    encoders.location.module = 'CategoricalAutoEncoder',
    encoders.rental_price.module = 'NumericEncoder',
    encoders.rental_price.args.positive_domain = 'True',
    model.args = {"submodels": [
                    {"module": "LightGBM",
                     "args": {
                          "stop_after": 12,
                          "fit_on_dev": true
                          }
                    }
                ]};
```

## Explainability

With Lightwood, you can deploy the following types of models:

- regressions models,
- classification models,
- time-series models.

Predictions made by each type of model come with an explanation column, as below.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Regression">
In the case of regression models, the `target_explain` column contains the following information:

```
{"predicted_value": 2951, "confidence": 0.99, "anomaly": null, "truth": null, "confidence_lower_bound": 2795, "confidence_upper_bound": 3107}
```

<Note>
The upper and lower bounds are determined via conformal prediction, and correspond to the reported confidence score (which can be modified by the user).
</Note>

Try it out following [this tutorial](/use-cases/in-database_ml/home-rentals).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Classification">
In the case of classification models, the `target_explain` column contains the following information:

```
{"predicted_value": "No", "confidence": 0.6629213483146067, "anomaly": null, "truth": null, "probability_class_No": 0.8561, "probability_class_Yes": 0.1439}
```

<Note>
The `confidence` score is produced by the conformal prediction module and is well-calibrated. On the other hand, the `probability_class` comes directly from the model logits, which may be uncalibrated. Therefore, the `probability_class` score may be optimistic or pessimistic, i.e. coverage is not guaranteed to empirically match the reported score.
</Note>

Try it out following [this tutorial](/use-cases/in-database_ml/customer-churn).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Time-Series">
In the case of time-series models, the `target_explain` column contains the following information:

```
{"predicted_value": 501618.3125, "confidence": 0.9991, "anomaly": false, "truth": null, "confidence_lower_bound": 500926.109375, "confidence_upper_bound": 502310.515625}
```
