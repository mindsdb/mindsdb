This documentation describes the integration of MindsDB with [LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/), a framework that simplifies access to models of various providers.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](https://docs.mindsdb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.mindsdb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To use LiteLLM within MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
3. Obtain the API key of the model provider, if required.

## Setup

Create an AI engine from the [LiteLLM handler](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/tree/main/mindsdb/integrations/handlers/litellm_handler).

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE litellm
FROM litellm;
```

Create a model using `litellm` as an engine.

```sql
CREATE MODEL litellm_model
PREDICT target_column
USING
    engine = "litellm_engine",
    model = "gpt-4",
    base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1",
    api_key = "sk-xxx",
    prompt_template = "answer questions in three bullet points: {{question}}";
```

The parameters include:

* `engine` is the LiteLLM engine created based on the LiteLLM handler with the [`CREATE ML_ENGINE`](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/ml-engine) statement.

* `model` is the one of the models supported by LiteLLM. See the [complete list of the supported providers and models here](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers).

* `base_url` is an optional parameter that stores the base URL for accessing models.

* `api_key` stores the API key of the provider whose model is used.

* `prompt_template` stores the instructions to the model.

## Usage

Here is how to create and use models through LiteLLM in MindsDB.

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE litellm
FROM litellm;

CREATE MODEL chat_model
PREDICT result
USING
    engine = "litellm",
    model = "gpt-4o",
    api_key = "sk-xxx";

SELECT *
FROM chat_model
WHERE question = "what is ai?";
```
