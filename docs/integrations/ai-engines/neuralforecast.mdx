Nixtla’s NeuralForecast provides a diverse array of neural forecasting models, prioritizing their ease of use and resilience. These models encompass a spectrum of options, including traditional networks like MLP and RNNs, as well as cutting-edge innovations such as NBEATS, NHITS, TFT, and various other architectural approaches.

You can learn more about its features [here](https://nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/).

## How to bring NeuralForecast Models to MindsDB

Before creating a model, you will need to create an ML engine for NeuralForecast using the `CREATE ML_ENGINE` statement:

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE neuralforecast
FROM neuralforecast;
```

Once the ML engine is created, we use the `CREATE MODEL` statement to create the NeuralForecast model in MindsDB.

```sql
CREATE MODEL model_name
FROM data_source
  (SELECT * FROM table_name)
PREDICT column_to_be_predicted
GROUP BY column_name, column_name, ...
ORDER BY date_column
WINDOW 12 -- model looks back at sets of 12 rows each
HORIZON 3 -- model forecasts the next 3 rows
USING
    engine = 'neuralforecast'
    frequency = 'Q',
    train_time = 0.01,
    exogenous_vars = ['var_1', 'var_2'];
```

To ensure that the model is created based on the NeuralForecast engine, include the `USING` clause at the end.

The `frequency` parameter informs the model about the expected time difference between each measurement ([supported values here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases)). And the `train_time` parameter defines the training time - it defaults to 1, and lower values will reduce training time linearly by reducing the number of searches allowed for the best configuration by AutoNHITS. You can also define `exogenous_vars` as a parameter in the `USING` clause - these are complementary variables in the table that may improve forecast accuracy.

## Example

Let's go through an example of how to use Nixtla's NeuralForecast with MindsDB to forecast monthly expenditures based on historical data.

Please note that before using the NeuralForecast engine, you should create it from the MindsDB editor, or other clients through which you interact with MindsDB, with the below command:

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE neuralforecast
FROM neuralforecast;
```

You can check the available engines with this command:

```sql
SHOW ML_ENGINES;
```

If you see the NeuralForecast engine on the list, you are ready to follow the tutorials.

We use a table from our MySQL public demo database, so let’s start by connecting MindsDB to it:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mysql_demo_db
WITH ENGINE = 'mysql',
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "user",
    "password": "MindsDBUser123!",
    "host": "samples.mindsdb.com",
    "port": "3306",
    "database": "public"
};
```

Now that we’ve connected our database to MindsDB, let’s query the data to be used in the example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mysql_demo_db.historical_expenditures
LIMIT 3;
```

Here is the output:

```sql
+------------+----------+-------------+
| month      | category | expenditure |
+------------+----------+-------------+
| 1982-04-01 | clothing | 359.9       |
| 1982-05-01 | clothing | 386.6       |
| 1982-06-01 | clothing | 350.5       |
+------------+----------+-------------+
```

The `historical_expenditures` table stores monthly expenditure data for various categories, such as `food`, `clothing`, `industry`, and more.

Let's create a model table to predict the expenditures:

```sql
CREATE MODEL quarterly_expenditure_forecaster
FROM mysql_demo_db
  (SELECT * FROM historical_expenditures)
PREDICT expenditure
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY month
WINDOW 12
HORIZON 3
USING ENGINE = 'neuralforecast';
```

The `CREATE MODEL` statement creates, trains, and deploys the model. Here, we predict the `expenditure` column values. As it is a time series model, we order the data by the `month` column. Additionally, we group data by the `category` column - the predictions are made for each group independently (here, for each category).

Next, we define the `WINDOW` and `HORIZON` clauses. The `WINDOW` clause specifies the number of rows we look back at (here, we look back at sets of 12 rows). And the `HORIZON` clause defines for how many rows the predictions are made (here, for the next 3 rows).

<Tip>
Please visit our docs on the [`CREATE MODEL`](/sql/create/model) statement to learn more.
</Tip>

The `ENGINE` parameter in the `USING` clause specifies the ML engine used to make predictions.

We can check the training status with the following query:

```sql
DESCRIBE quarterly_expenditure_forecaster;
```

Once the model status is `complete`, the behavior is the same as with any other AI table – you can query for batch predictions by joining it with a data table:

```sql
SELECT m.month as month, m.expenditure as forecasted
FROM mindsdb.quarterly_expenditure_forecaster as m
JOIN mysql_demo_db.historical_expenditures as t
WHERE t.month > LATEST
AND t.category = 'clothing';
```

Here is the output data:

```sql
+----------------------------+------------------+
| month                      | forecasted       |
+----------------------------+------------------+
| 2017-10-01 00:00:00.000000 | 10802.2109375    |
| 2017-11-01 00:00:00.000000 | 10749.2041015625 |
| 2017-12-01 00:00:00.000000 | 12423.849609375  |
+----------------------------+------------------+
```

The `historical_expenditures` table is used to make batch predictions. Upon joining the `quarterly_expenditure_forecaster` model with the `historical_expenditures` table, we get predictions for the next quarter as defined by the `HORIZON 3` clause.

Please note that the output `month` column contains both the date and timestamp. This format is used by default, as the timestamp is required when dealing with the hourly frequency of data.

MindsDB provides the `LATEST` keyword that marks the latest training data point. In the `WHERE` clause, we specify the `month > LATEST` condition to ensure the predictions are made for data after the latest training data point.

Let’s consider our `quarterly_expenditure_forecaster` model. We train the model using data until the third quarter of 2017, and the predictions come for the fourth quarter of 2017 (as defined by `HORIZON 3`).

## NeuralForecast + HierarchicalForecast

The NeuralForecast handler also supports hierarchical reconciliation via Nixtla’s [HierarchicalForecast package](https://nixtla.github.io/hierarchicalforecast/). Hierarchical reconciliation may improve prediction accuracy when the data has a hierarchical structure.

In this example, there may be a hierarchy as total expenditure is comprised of 7 different categories.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT category
FROM mysql_demo_db.historical_expenditures;
```

Here are the available categories:

```sql
+-------------------+
| category          |
+-------------------+
| food              |
| household_goods   |
| clothing          |
| department_stores |
| other             |
| cafes             |
| industry          |
+-------------------+
```

Spending in each category may be related over time. For example, if spending on `food` rises in October 2017, it may be more likely that spending on `cafes` also rises in October 2017. Hierarchical reconciliation can account for this shared information.

Here is how we can create a model:

```sql
CREATE MODEL hierarchical_expenditure_forecaster
FROM mysql_demo_db
  (SELECT * FROM historical_expenditures)
PREDICT expenditure
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY month
HORIZON 3
USING
  ENGINE = 'neuralforecast',
  HIERARCHY = [‘category’];
```

Predictions with this model account for the hierarchical structure. The output may differ from the default model, which does not assume any hierarchy.
