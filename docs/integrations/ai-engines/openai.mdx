This documentation describes the integration of MindsDB with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), an AI research organization known for developing AI models like GPT-3 and GPT-4.
The integration allows for the deployment of OpenAI models within MindsDB, providing the models with access to data from various data sources.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](https://docs.mindsdb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.mindsdb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To use OpenAI within MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
3. Obtain the OpenAI API key required to deploy and use OpenAI models within MindsDB. Follow the [instructions for obtaining the API key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key).

## Setup

Create an AI engine from the [OpenAI handler](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/tree/main/mindsdb/integrations/handlers/openai_handler).

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE openai_engine
FROM openai
USING
      openai_api_key = 'api-key-value';
```

Create a model using `openai_engine` as an engine.

```sql
CREATE MODEL openai_model
PREDICT target_column
USING
      engine = 'openai_engine',  -- engine name as created via CREATE ML_ENGINE
      mode = 'mode_name', -- optional, ...
      model_name = 'openai_model_name',  -- optional with default value of gpt-3.5-turbo
      question_column = 'question',  -- optional, column name that stores user input
      context_column = 'context',  -- optional, column that stores context of the user input
      prompt_template = 'input message to the model here', -- optional, user provides instructions to the model here
      max_tokens = 100, -- optional, token limit for answer
      temperature = 0.3, -- temp

```

<Tip>
If you want to update the `prompt_template` parameter, you do not have to recreate the model. Instead, you can override the `prompt_template` parameter at prediction time like this:

```sql
SELECT question, answer
FROM openai_model
WHERE question = 'input question here'
USING prompt_template = 'input new message to the model here';
```
</Tip>

The following parameters are available to use when creating an OpenAI model:

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="engine">
    This is the engine name as created with the [`CREATE ML_ENGINE`](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/ml-engine) statement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="mode">
    This parameter is optional.

    The available modes include `default`, `conversational`, `conversational-full`, `image`, and `embedding`.

    - The `default` mode is used by default. The model replies to the `prompt_template` message.
    - The `conversational` mode enables the model to read and reply to multiple messages.
    - The `conversational-full` mode enables the model to read and reply to multiple messages, one reply per message.
    - The `image` mode is used to create an image instead of a text reply.
    - The `embedding` mode enables the model to return output in the form of embeddings.

    You can find [all models supported by each mode here](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/main/mindsdb/integrations/handlers/openai_handler/constants.py).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="model_name">
    This parameter is optional. By default, the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model is used.

    You can find [all available models here](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/main/mindsdb/integrations/handlers/openai_handler/constants.py).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="question_column">
    This parameter is optional. It contains the column name that stores user input.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="context_column">
    This parameter is optional. It contains the column name that stores context for the user input.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="prompt_template">
    This parameter is optional if you use `question_column`. It stores the message or instructions to the model. *Please note that this parameter can be overridden at prediction time.*
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="max_tokens">
    This parameter is optional. It defines the maximum token cost of the prediction. *Please note that this parameter can be overridden at prediction time.*
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="temperature">
    This parameter is optional. It defines how *risky* the answers are. The value of `0` marks a well-defined answer, and the value of `0.9` marks a more creative answer. *Please note that this parameter can be overridden at prediction time.*
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage

The following usage examples utilize `openai_engine` to create a model with the `CREATE MODEL` statement.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Answering questions without context">
    Here is how to create a model that answers questions without context.

    ```sql
    CREATE MODEL openai_model
    PREDICT answer
    USING
        engine = 'openai_engine',
        question_column = 'question';
    ```

    Query the model to get predictions.

    ```sql
    SELECT question, answer
    FROM openai_model
    WHERE question = 'Where is Stockholm located?';
    ```

    Here is the output:

    ```sql
    +---------------------------+-------------------------------+
    |question                   |answer                         |
    +---------------------------+-------------------------------+
    |Where is Stockholm located?|Stockholm is located in Sweden.|
    +---------------------------+-------------------------------+
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Answering questions with context">
    Here is how to create a model that answers questions with context.

    ```sql
    CREATE MODEL openai_model
    PREDICT answer
    USING
        engine = 'openai_engine',
        question_column = 'question',
        context_column = 'context';
    ```

    Query the model to get predictions.

    ```sql
    SELECT context, question, answer
    FROM openai_model
    WHERE context = 'Answer accurately'
    AND question = 'How many planets exist in the solar system?';
    ```

    On execution, we get:

    ```sql
    +-------------------+-------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
    |context            |question                                   |answer                                        |
    +-------------------+-------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
    |Answer accurately  |How many planets exist in the solar system?| There are eight planets in the solar system. |
    +-------------------+-------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Prompt completion">
    Here is how to create a model that offers the most flexible mode of operation. It answers any query provided in the `prompt_template` parameter.

    <Tip>
    Good prompts are the key to getting great completions out of large language models like the ones that OpenAI offers. For best performance, we recommend you read their [prompting guide](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/prompt-design) before trying your hand at prompt templating.
    </Tip>

    Let's look at an example that reuses the `openai_model` model created earlier and overrides parameters at prediction time.

    ```sql
    SELECT instruction, answer
    FROM openai_model
    WHERE instruction = 'Speculate extensively'
    USING
        prompt_template = '{{instruction}}. What does Tom Hanks like?',
        max_tokens = 100,
        temperature = 0.5;
    ```

    On execution, we get:

    ```sql
    +----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |instruction           |answer                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
    +----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |Speculate extensively |Some people speculate that Tom Hanks likes to play golf, while others believe that he enjoys acting and directing. It is also speculated that he likes to spend time with his family and friends, and that he enjoys traveling.|
    +----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
