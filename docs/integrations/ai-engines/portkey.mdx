This documentation describes the integration of MindsDB with [Portkey](https://www.portkey.com/), an AI Gateway that allows developers to connect to All the AI models in the world with a single API.
Portkey also brings in observability, caching, and other features that are useful for building production-grade AI applications.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](https://docs.mindsdb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.mindsdb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To use Portkey within MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](https://docs.mindsdb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
3. Obtain the Portkey API key required to deploy and use Portkey within MindsDB. Follow the [instructions for obtaining the API key](https://docs.portkey.ai/docs/api-reference/introduction).

## Setup

Create an AI engine from the [Portkey handler](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/tree/main/mindsdb/integrations/handlers/portkey_handler).

<Info>
You can pass all the parameters that are supported by Portkey inside the `USING` clause.
</Info>


```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE portkey_engine
FROM portkey
USING
    portkey_api_key = '{PORTKEY_API_KEY}', -- get this from Portkey dashboard (https://app.portkey.ai/api-keys)
    config = '{PORTKEY_CONFIG_ID}'; -- get this from Portkey dashboard (https://app.portkey.ai/configs)
```

Create a model using `portkey_engine` as an engine.
<Info>
You can pass all the parameters supported by Portkey Chat completions here inside the `USING` clause. 
refer [Portkey Chat completions](https://docs.portkey.ai/docs/provider-endpoints/chat) for more details.
</Info>

```sql
CREATE MODEL portkey_model
PREDICT answer
USING
      engine = 'portkey_engine',
      model = 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
      temperature = 0.2;
```

<Info>
The integrations between Portkey and MindsDB was implemented using [Portkey Python SDK](https://docs.portkey.ai/docs/api-reference/portkey-sdk-client).
</Info>

Query the model to get predictions.

```sql
SELECT question, answer
FROM portkey_model
WHERE question = 'Where is Stockholm located?';
```

Here is the output:

```sql
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| question                    | answer                                                                                                                                             |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Where is Stockholm located? |  Stockholm is the capital and largest city of Sweden. It is located on Sweden's south-central east coast, where Lake MÃ¤laren meets the Baltic Sea. |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## Usage

The following usage examples utilize `portkey_engine` and `gpt-3.5-turbo` to create a model with the `CREATE MODEL` statement.

### Creating a Summarization Model

This example demonstrates how to create a model to summarize text using Portkey:

```sql
CREATE MODEL summarization_model
PREDICT summary
USING
    engine = 'portkey_engine',
    model = 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    temperature = 0.5,
    max_tokens = 100;

SELECT document, summary
FROM summarization_model
WHERE document = 'MindsDB is a predictive platform that connects machine learning models with databases.';

```

### Generating Sentiment Analysis

```sql
CREATE MODEL sentiment_model
PREDICT sentiment
USING
    engine = 'portkey_engine',
    model = 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    temperature = 0.3;

SELECT review, sentiment
FROM sentiment_model
WHERE review = 'The product was excellent and exceeded expectations!';

```

### Translating Text

```sql
CREATE MODEL translation_model
PREDICT translation
USING
    engine = 'portkey_engine',
    model = 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    temperature = 0.4;

SELECT original_text, translation
FROM translation_model
WHERE original_text = 'Hello, how are you?' AND target_language = 'es';

```

### Extracting Key Information

```sql
CREATE MODEL extraction_model
PREDICT extracted_data
USING
    engine = 'portkey_engine',
    model = 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    temperature = 0.6;

SELECT text, extracted_data
FROM extraction_model
WHERE text = 'Minds , 35, lives in New York and works as a software engineer.';

```
