This handler was implemented using the `replicate` library that is provided by Replicate.

The required arguments to establish a connection are,

* model_name: Model name which you want to access in MindsDB. e.g 'air-forever/kandinsky-2'
* version: version hash/id which you want to use in MindsDB.
* api_key: API key from Replicate Platform you can found [here](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens).
* model_type: It should be set to '**LLM**' while using Large language Model else it Optional

<Note> 

Before you can use Replicate, it's essential to authenticate by setting your API token in an environment variable named REPLICATE_API_TOKEN.
 This token acts as a key to enable access to Replicate's features.

1. Using pip:

If you're working in a standard Python environment (using pip for package management), set your token as an environment variable by running the following command 
in your terminal:

On Linux, Mac:
```
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN='YOUR_TOKEN'
```
On Windows:

```
set REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
```


2. Using Docker:

For Docker users, the process slightly differs. You need to pass the environment variable directly to the Docker container when running it. Use this command:

```
docker run -e REPLICATE_API_TOKEN='YOUR_TOKEN' -p 47334:47334 -p 47335:47335 mindsdb/mindsdb
```

Again, replace 'YOUR_TOKEN' with your actual Replicate API token.
</Note>

## Usage
To use this handler and connect to a Replicate cluster in MindsDB, you need an account on Replicate. Make sure to create an account by following this [link](https://replicate.com/signin?next=/account/api-tokens).


To establish the connection and create a model in MindsDB, use the following syntax:
```sql
CREATE MODEL vicuna_13b
PREDICT output
USING
    engine = 'replicate',
    model_name= 'replicate/vicuna_13b',
    model_type='LLM',
    version ='6282abe6a492de4145d7bb601023762212f9ddbbe78278bd6771c8b3b2f2a13b',
    api_key = 'r8_HEH............';
```

You can use the DESCRIBE PREDICTOR query to see the available parameters that you can specify to customize your predictions:
```sql
DESCRIBE PREDICTOR mindsdb.vicuna_13b.features;
```

### OUTPUT
```sql
+--------------------+---------+---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

| debug              | boolean | False   | provide debugging output in logs                                                                                                      |
| top_p              | number  | 1       | When decoding text, samples from the top p percentage of most likely tokens; lower to ignore less likely tokens                       |
| prompt             | string  | -       | Prompt to send to Llama.                                                                                                              |
| max_length         | integer | 500     | Maximum number of tokens to generate. A word is generally 2-3 tokens                                                                  |
| temperature        | number  | 0.75    | Adjusts randomness of outputs, greater than 1 is random and 0 is deterministic, 0.75 is a good starting value.                        |
| repetition_penalty | number  | 1       | Penalty for repeated words in generated text; 1 is no penalty, values greater than 1 discourage repetition, less than 1 encourage it. |
+--------------------+---------+---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Now, you can use the established connection to query your ML Model as follows:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM vicuna_13b
WHERE prompt='Write a humourous  poem on Open Source'
USING
 max_length=200,
 temperature=0.75;
```
### OUTPUT
```sql

| With open source, there's no end                             |                                        |
