In this section, we present how to connect to Binance and create a time series model to predict the future price of Bitcoin (BTC)

## Connection

This handler integrates with the [Binance API](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/#change-log) to make aggregate trade (kline) data available to use for model training and predictions.

Since there are no parameters required to connect to Binance using MindsDB, you can use the below statement:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_binance
WITH
  ENGINE = 'binance';
```

## Usage

### Select Data
By default, aggregate data (klines) from the latest 1000 trading intervals with a length of one minute (1m) each will be returned.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM my_binance.aggregated_trade_data
WHERE symbol = 'BTCUSDT';
```
<Accordion title="Response" icon="binance" iconType="thin">
    Here is the sample output data:

    ```
    | symbol      | open_time    | open_price  | high_price  | low_price   | close_price | volume      | close_time    | quote_asset_volume | number_of_trades | taker_buy_base_asset_volume | taker_buy_quote_asset_volume |
    | ----------- | -----------  | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | -----------   | ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
    | BTCUSDT     | 1678338600   | 21752.65000 | 21761.33000 | 21751.53000 | 21756.7000  | 103.8614100 | 1678338659.999| 2259656.20520700   | 3655             | 55.25763000                 | 1202219.60971860             |
    ```
    where:
    * `symbol` - Trading pair (BTC to USDT in the above example)
    * `open_time` - Start time of interval in seconds since the Unix epoch (default interval is 1m)
    * `open_price` - Price of base asset at beginning of trading interval
    * `high_price` - Highest price of base asset during trading interval
    * `low_price` - Lowest price of base asset during trading interval
    * `close_price` - Price of base asset at end of trading interval
    * `volume` - Total amount of base asset traded during interval
    * `close_time` - End time of interval in seconds since the Unix epoch
    * `quote_asset_volume` - Total amount of quote asset (USDT in above case) traded during interval
    * `number_of_trades` - Total number of trades made during interval
    * `taker_buy_base_asset_volume` - How much of the base asset volume is contributed by taker buy orders
    * `taker_buy_quote_asset_volume` - How much of the quote asset volume is contributed by taker buy orders
</Accordion>

To get a customized response we can pass open_time, close_time, and interval:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM my_binance.aggregated_trade_data
WHERE symbol = 'BTCUSDT'
AND open_time > '2023-01-01'
AND close_time < '2023-01-03 08:00:00'
AND interval = '1s'
LIMIT 10000;
```

<Note>
Supported intervals are [listed here](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/#kline-candlestick-data)
</Note>

### Train a Model

Here is how to create a time series model using 10000 trading intervals in the past with duration of 1m.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.btc_forecast_model
FROM my_binance
(
  SELECT * FROM aggregated_trade_data
  WHERE symbol = 'BTCUSDT'
  AND close_time < '2023-01-01'
  AND interval = '1m'
  LIMIT 10000;
)

PREDICT open_price

ORDER BY open_time
WINDOW 100
HORIZON 10;
```

<Note>
For more accuracy, the limit can be set to a higher value (e.g. 100,000)
</Note>

### Making Predictions

First let's make a view for the most recent BTCUSDT aggregate trade data:

```sql
CREATE VIEW recent_btcusdt_data AS (
  SELECT * FROM my_binance.aggregated_trade_data
  WHERE symbol = 'BTCUSDT'
)
```

Now let's predict the future price of BTC:

```sql
SELECT m.*
FROM recent_btcusdt_data AS t
JOIN mindsdb.btc_forecast_model AS m
WHERE m.open_time > LATEST
```

This will give the predicted BTC price for the next 10 minutes (as the horizon is set to 10) in terms of USDT.
