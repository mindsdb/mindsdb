In this section, we present how to connect Confluence to MindsDB.

[Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) is a popular collaboration and documentation tool developed by Atlassian, a software company known for its suite of productivity and project management software. Confluence is designed to help teams and organizations collaborate, share information, and create and manage various types of content.

Data from Confluence can be utilized within MindsDB to train AI models and make predictions.

## Connection

This handler is implemented using `atlassian-python-api`, a library that provides a simple and convenient way to interact with Atlassian products.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `url` is a Confluence-hosted URL instance.
* `confluence_api_token` is a token used to authenticate.

<Tip>
Please follow [this link](https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Content-Sources/Atlassian-Jira-Confluence-Authentication-Create-API-Token.htm) to generate the token for accessing the Confluence API.
</Tip>

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/confluence_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

In order to make use of this handler and connect the Confluence app to MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_confluence
WITH
    ENGINE = 'confluence',
    PARAMETERS = {
    "url": "your_confluence_url",
    "username": "your_username",
    "password":"access_token"
    };
```

It creates a database that comes with the `pages` table.

## Usage

Now you can query your data, like this:

```sql
SELECT id, key, name, type
FROM mindsdb_confluence.pages
WHERE type = "personal"
ORDER BY id ASC, name DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
