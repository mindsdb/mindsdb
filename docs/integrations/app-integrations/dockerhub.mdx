In this section, we present how to connect Docker Hub repository to MindsDB.

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is the world's easiest way to create, manage, and deliver your team's container applications.

Data from Docker Hub can be utilized within MindsDB to train models and make predictions about Docker Hub repositories.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To connect Docker Hub to MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
3. Install or ensure access to Docker Hub.

## Connection

This handler is implemented using the `requests` library that makes http calls to https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/api/latest/#tag/resources.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `username`: Username used to login to DockerHub.
* `password`: Password used to login to DockerHub.

<Tip>
Read about creating an account [here](https://hub.docker.com/).

Here is how to connect to Docker Hub using MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE dockerhub_datasouce
WITH ENGINE = 'dockerhub',
PARAMETERS = {
  "username": "username",
  "password": "password"
};
```

## Usage

Now, you can query Docker Hub as follows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM dockerhub_datasouce.repo_images_summary WHERE namespace="docker" AND repository="trusted-registry-nginx";
```

<Tip>
Both the `namespace` and `repository` parameters are required in the WHERE clause.
