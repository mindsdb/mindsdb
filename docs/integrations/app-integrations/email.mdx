## Connection

This handler was implemented using standard Python libraries: `email`, `imaplib`, and `smtplib`.

The Email handler is initialized with the following required parameters:

* `email` stores an email address used for authentication.
* `password` stores a password used for authentication.

Additionally, the following optional parameters can be passed:

* `smtp_server` used to send emails. Defaults to `smtp.gmail.com`.
* `smtp_port` used to send emails. Defaults to `587`.
* `imap_server` used to receive emails. Defaults to `imap.gmail.com`.

<Tip>
At the moment, the handler has been tested with Gmail and Outlook accounts.

To use the handler on a Gmail account, you must create an app password following [this instruction](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) and use its value for the `password` parameter.

By default, the Email handler connects to Gmail. If you want to use other email providers as Outlook, add the values for `imap_server` and `smtp_server` parameters.

### Gmail

To connect your Gmail account to MindsDB, use the below `CREATE DATABASE` statement:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE email_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'email',
PARAMETERS = {
  "email": "youremail@gmail.com",
  "password": "yourpassword"
};
```

It creates a database that comes with the `emails` table.

### Outlook

To connect your Outlook account to MindsDB, use the below `CREATE DATABASE` statement:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE email_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'email',
PARAMETERS = {
  "email": "youremail@gmail.com",
  "password": "yourpassword",
  "smtp_server": "smtp.office365.com", 
  "smtp_port": "587", 
  "imap_server": "outlook.office365.com" 
};
```

It creates a database that comes with the `emails` table.

## Usage

Now you can query for emails like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM email_datasource.emails;
```

And you can apply filters like this:

```sql
SELECT id, body, subject, to_field, from_field, datetime
FROM email_datasource.emails
WHERE subject = 'MindsDB'
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 5;
```

Or, write emails like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO email_datasource.emails(to_field, subject, body)
VALUES ("toemail@outlook.com", "MindsDB", "Hello from MindsDB!");
```
