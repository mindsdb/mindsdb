In this section, we present how to connect GitHub repository to MindsDB.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web-based platform and service that is primarily used for version control and collaborative software development. It provides a platform for developers and teams to host, review, and manage source code for software projects.

Data from GitHub, including issues and PRs, can be utilized within MindsDB to make relevant predictions or automate the issue/PR creation.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To connect GitHub to MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
3. Install or ensure access to GitHub.

## Connection

This handler is implemented using the `pygithub` library, a Python library that wraps GitHub API v3.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `repository` is the GitHub repository name.
* `api_key` is an optional GitHub API key to use for authentication.
* `github_url` is an optional GitHub URL to connect to a GitHub Enterprise instance.

<Tip>
Check out [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) on how to create the GitHub API key.

It is recommended to use the API key to avoid the `API rate limit exceeded` error.

Here is how to connect the MindsDB GitHub repository:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_github
WITH ENGINE = 'github',
PARAMETERS = {
  "repository": "mindsdb/mindsdb"
};
```

## Usage

The `mindsdb_github` connection contains two tables: `issues` and `pull_requests`.

Here is how to query for all issues:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mindsdb_github.issues;
```

You can run more advanced queries to fetch specific issues in a defined order:

```sql
SELECT number, state, creator, assignees, title, labels
FROM mindsdb_github.issues
WHERE state = 'open'
LIMIT 10;
```

And the same goes for pull requests:

```sql
SELECT number, state, title, creator, head, commits
FROM mindsdb_github.pull_requests
WHERE state = 'open'
LIMIT 10;
```
