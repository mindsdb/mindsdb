In this section, we present how to connect Google Analytics to MindsDB.

[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic and also the mobile app traffic & events.

Data from Google Analytics can be utilized within MindsDB to train AI models, make predictions, and automate user engagement and events with AI.

## Connection

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `credentials_file` optional, is a path to the JSON file that stores credentials to the Google account.
* `credentials_json`: optional, is the content of the JSON file that stores credentials to the Google account.
* `property_id` required, is the property id of your Google Analytics website. [Here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/property-id) is some information on how to get the property id.
> ⚠️ One of credentials_file or credentials_json has to be chosen.

<Tip>
Please note that a Google account with enabled Google Analytics Admin API is required. You can find more information [here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/admin/v1/quickstart-client-libraries).<br></br>
Also an active website connected with Google Analytics is required. You can find more information [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153?hl=en).
</Tip>

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip or cloned it, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/google_analytics_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

To make use of this handler and connect the Google Analytics app to MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_ga
WITH
    ENGINE = 'google_analytics',
    PARAMETERS = {
        'credentials_file': '\path-to-your-file\credentials.json',
        'property_id': '<YOUR_PROPERTY_ID>'
    };
```
<Tip>

You need a Google account in order to use this integration. Here is how to get the credentials file:

1. Create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project:

    1.1 Go to the GCP Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/).

    1.2 If you haven't created a project before, you'll be prompted to do so now.

    1.3 Give your new project a name.

    1.4 Click `Create` to create the new project.

2. Enable the Google Analytics Admin API:

    2.1 In the GCP Console, select your project.

    2.2 Navigate to `APIs & Services` > `Library`.

    2.3 In the search bar, search for `Google Analytics Admin API`.

    2.4 Click on ` Google Analytics Admin API `, then click `Enable`.

3. Create credentials for the  Google Analytics Admin API :

    3.1 Navigate to `APIs & Services` > `Credentials`.

    3.2 Click on the `Create Credentials` button and choose `Service account`.

    3.3 Enter a unique `Service account ID` .

    3.4 Click `Done`.

    3.5 Copy the service account you created. Find it under `Service Accounts`.

    3.6 Now click on the service account you created, and navigate `KEYS`

    3.7 Click `ADD KEY` > `Create new key`.

    3.8 Choose `JSON` then click `CREATE`

    3.9 After this the credentials file will be downloaded directly. Locate the file and use the location to it in the `credentials_file` param.

4. Add Service account to Google Analytics Property:

    4.1 In the Google Analytics Admin Console, select the Account or Property to which you want to grant access.

    4.2 Navigate to the `Admin` panel.

    4.3 Navigate `Account` > `Account Access Management`.

    4.4 Click on the "+" icon to add a new user.

    4.5 Enter the service account you copied in step 3.5 as the email address.

    4.6 Assign the appropriate permissions to the service account. At a minimum, you'll need to grant it `Edit` permissions.

    4.7 Click on the `Add` button to add the service account as a user with the specified permissions.
</Tip>

## Usage

This creates a database that comes with the `conversion_events` table.

Now you can use your Google Analytics data like this:

* searching for conversion events:

    ```sql
    SELECT event_name, custom, countingMethod
    FROM my_ga.conversion_events;
    ```

* creating conversion event:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO my_ga.conversion_events (event_name, countingMethod)
    VALUES ('mindsdb_event', 2);
    ```

* updating one conversion event:

    ```sql
    UPDATE my_ga.conversion_events
    SET countingMethod = 1,
    WHERE name = '<mindsdb_event_name>';
    ```

* deleting one conversion event:

    ```sql
    DELETE
    FROM my_ga.conversion_events
    WHERE name = '<mindsdb_event_name>';
    ```
