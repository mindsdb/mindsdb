In this section, we present how to connect Google Calendar to MindsDB.

[Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/) is an online calendar service and application developed by Google. It allows users to create, manage, and share events and appointments, as well as schedule and organize their personal, work, or team activities.

Data from Google Calendar can be utilized within MindsDB to train AI models, make predictions, and automate time management with AI.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To connect Google Calendar to MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
3. Install or ensure access to Google Calendar.

## Connection

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `credentials_file` is a path to the JSON file that stores credentials to the Google account.

<Tip>
Please note that a Google account with enabled Google Calendar is required. You can find more information [here](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python).
</Tip>

In order to make use of this handler and connect the Google Calendar app to MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_calendar
WITH
    ENGINE = 'google_calendar',
    PARAMETERS = {
        'credentials_file': '\path-to-your-file\credentials.json'
    }; 
```
<Tip>
    
You need a Google account in order to use this integration. Here is how to get the credentials file:

1. Create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project:

    1.1 Go to the GCP Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    
    1.2 If you haven't created a project before, you'll be prompted to do so now.
    
    1.3 Give your new project a name.
    
    1.4 Click `Create` to create the new project.

2. Enable the Google Calendar API:

    2.1 In the GCP Console, select your project.

    2.2 Navigate to `APIs & Services` > `Library`.

    2.3 In the search bar, search for `Google Calendar API`.

    2.4 Click on ` Google Calendar API `, then click `Enable`.

3. Create credentials for the  Google Calendar API :

    3.1 Navigate to `APIs & Services` > `Credentials`.

    3.2 Click on the `Create Credentials` button and choose `OAuth client ID`.

    3.3 If you haven't configured the OAuth consent screen before, you'll be prompted to do so now. Make sure to choose `External` for User Type, and add all the necessary scopes. Make sure to save the changes.
    Now, create the OAuth client ID. Choose `Desktop app` for the Application Type and give it a name.

    3.4 Click `Create`.

4. Download the JSON file:

    4.1 After creating your credentials, click the download button (an icon of an arrow pointing down) on the right side of your client ID. This will download a JSON file, so you will use the location to it in the `credentials_file` param. 
</Tip>

## Usage

This creates a database that comes with the `calendar` table.

Now you can use your Google Calendar data, like this:

* searching for events:

    ```sql
    SELECT id, created_at, author_username, text
    FROM my_calendar.events
    WHERE start_time = '2023-02-16'
    AND end_time = '2023-04-09' LIMIT 20;
    ```

* creating events:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO my_calendar.events(start_time, end_time, summary, description, location, attendees, reminders, timeZone)
    VALUES ('2023-02-16 10:00:00', '2023-02-16 11:00:00', 'MindsDB Meeting', 'Discussing the future of MindsDB', 'MindsDB HQ', '', 'Europe/Athens');
    ```

* updating one or more events:

    ```sql
    UPDATE my_calendar.events
    SET summary     = 'MindsDB Meeting',
        description = 'Discussing the future of MindsDB',
        location    = 'MindsDB HQ',
        attendees   = '',
        reminders   = ''
    WHERE event_id > 1 AND event_id < 10;                   -- used to update events in a given range
    ```

* deleting one or more events:

    ```sql
    DELETE
    FROM my_calendar.events
    WHERE id = '1';
    ```
