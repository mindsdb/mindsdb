In this section, we present how to connect News API to MindsDB.

[News API](https://newsapi.org/) is a simple HTTP REST API for searching and retrieving live articles from all over the web.

Data from News API can be utilized within MindsDB for model training and predictions.

## Connection

This handler is implemented using the [newsapi-python](https://newsapi.org/docs/client-libraries/python) library.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `api_key` News API key to use for authentication.

<Tip>
Check out [this guide](https://newsapi.org/docs/authentication) on how to create the API key.

It is recommended to use the API key to avoid the `API rate limit exceeded` error.
</Tip>

Here is how to connect News API to MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE newsAPI
WITH ENGINE = 'newsapi'
PARAMETERS = {
	"api_key": "Your api key"
};
```

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/newsapi_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

Simple Search for recent articles:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM newsAPI.article
WHERE query = 'Python';
```

Advanced search for recent articles per specific sources between dates:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM newsAPI.article
WHERE query = 'Python'
AND sources="bbc-news"
AND publishedAt >= "2021-03-23" AND  publishedAt <= "2023-04-23"
LIMIT 4;
```
