In this section, we present how to connect Shopify to MindsDB.

[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) is an e-commerce platform that enables businesses to create and manage online stores. It is one of the leading e-commerce solutions, providing a wide range of tools and services to help entrepreneurs and businesses sell products and services online.

Data from Shopify can be utilized within MindsDB to train AI models and chatbots using Products, Customers and Orders data, and make predictions relevant for businesses.

## Connection

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

- `shop_url`: a required URL to your Shopify store.
- `access_token`: a required access token to use for authentication.

<Tip>
Here is how you can [create a Shopify access token](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f_aiC5oTNc&t=302s).
</Tip>

Optionally, if you want to access customer reviews, provide the following parameters:

- `yotpo_app_key`: a token needed to access customer reviews via the Yotpo Product Reviews app.
- `yotpo_access_token`: a token needed to access customer reviews via the Yotpo Product Reviews app.

<Tip>
If you want to query customer reviews, use the [Yotpo Product Reviews](https://apps.shopify.com/yotpo-social-reviews) app available in Shopify. Here are the steps to follow:
1. Install the [Yotpo Product Reviews](https://apps.shopify.com/yotpo-social-reviews) app for your Shopify store.
2. Generate `yotpo_app_key` following [this instruction](https://support.yotpo.com/docs/finding-your-yotpo-app-key-and-secret-key) for retrieving your app key. Learn more about [Yotpo authentication here](https://apidocs.yotpo.com/reference/yotpo-authentication).
3. Generate `yotpo_access_token` following [this instruction](https://develop.yotpo.com/reference/generate-a-token).
</Tip>

To connect your Shopify account to MindsDB, you must first create a new handler instance. You can do it by the following query:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE shopify_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'shopify',
PARAMETERS = {
  "shop_url": "your-shop-name.myshopify.com",
  "access_token": "shppa_..."
};
```
