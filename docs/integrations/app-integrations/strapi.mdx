[Strapi](https://strapi.io/) is a popular open-source Headless Content Management System (CMS) that empowers developers to work with their preferred tools and frameworks, while providing content editors with a user-friendly interface to manage and distribute content across various platforms.

The Strapi Handler is a MindsDB handler that enables SQL-based querying of Strapi collections. This documentation provides a brief overview of its features, initialization parameters, and example usage.

## Connection

To use the Strapi Handler, initialize it with the following parameters:

- `host`: Strapi server host.
- `port`: Strapi server port (typically 1337).
- `api_token`: Strapi server API token for authentication.
- `plural_api_ids`: List of plural API IDs for the collections.

To get started, create a Strapi engine database with the following SQL command:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE myshop --- Display name for the database.
WITH ENGINE = 'strapi', --- Name of the MindsDB handler.
PARAMETERS = {
  "host" : "<strapi-host>", --- Host (can be an IP address or URL).
  "port" : "<strapi-port>",  --- Common port is 1337.
  "api_token": "<your-strapi-api-token>", --- API token of the Strapi server.
  "plural_api_ids" : ["<plural-api-id>"] --- Plural API IDs of the collections.
};
```

## Usage

Retrieve data from a collection:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM myshop.<collection-name>;
```

Filter data based on specific criteria:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM myshop.<collection-name>
WHERE documentId = '<documentId-value>';
```

Insert new data into a collection:

```sql
INSERT INTO myshop.<collection-name> (<field-name-1>, <field-name-2>, ...)
VALUES (<value-1>, <value-2>, ...);
```

<Tip>
  Note: You only able to insert data into the collection which has `create`
  permission.
</Tip>


Modify existing data in a collection:

```sql
UPDATE myshop.<collection-name>
SET <field-name-1> = <value-1>, <field-name-2> = <value-2>, ...
WHERE documentId = '<documentId-value>';
```

<Tip>
  Note: You only able to update data into the collection which has `update`
  permission.
