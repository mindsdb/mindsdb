In this section, we present how to connect YouTube to MindsDB.

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) is a popular online video-sharing platform and social media website where users
can upload, view, share, and interact with videos created by individuals and organizations from around the world.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

 1. Install MindsDB on your system or obtain access to cloud options.
 2. To use YouTube with MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).

1. Limited permissions: This option provides MindsDB with read-only access to YouTube, including viewing comments data.
2. Elevated permissions: This option provides MindsDB with full access to YouTube, including viewing comments data and posting replies to comments.

### Option 1: Limited permissions

## Usage

Use the established connection to query the `comments` table.

You can query for one video's comments:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM mindsdb_youtube.comments
WHERE video_id = "raWFGQ20OfA";
```

Or for one channels's comments:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM mindsdb_youtube.comments
WHERE channel_id="UC-...";
```

You can include ordering and limiting the output data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM mindsdb_youtube.comments
WHERE video_id = "raWFGQ20OfA"
ORDER BY display_name ASC
LIMIT 5;
```

Use the established connection to query the `channels` table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM mindsdb_youtube.channels
WHERE channel_id="UC-...";
```

Here, the `channel_id` column is mandatory in the `WHERE` clause.

Use the established connection to query the `videos` table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM mindsdb_youtube.videos
WHERE video_id="id";
```

Here, the `video_id` column is mandatory in the `WHERE` clause.

With the connection option 2, you can insert replies to comments:

```sql
INSERT INTO mindsdb_youtube_oauth.comments (comment_id, reply)
VALUES ("comment_id", "reply message");
```
