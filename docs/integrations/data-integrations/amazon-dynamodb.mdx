This is the implementation of the DynamoDB data handler for MindsDB.

[Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html) is a fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL database designed to run high-performance applications at any scale. DynamoDB offers built-in security, continuous backups, automated multi-region replication, in-memory caching, and data export tools.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To connect Amazon DynamoDB to MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
3. Install or ensure access to Amazon DynamoDB.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using `boto3`, the AWS SDK for Python.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `aws_access_key_id` is the AWS access key.
* `aws_secret_access_key` is the AWS secret access key.
* `region_name` is the AWS region.

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the DynamoDB database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE dynamodb_datasource
WITH
    engine = 'dynamodb',
    parameters = {
      "aws_access_key_id": "PCAQ2LJDOSWLNSQKOCPW",
      "aws_secret_access_key": "U/VjewPlNopsDmmwItl34r2neyC6WhZpUiip57i",
      "region_name": "us-east-1"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dynamodb_datasource.example_tbl;
```

<Tip>
Queries to DynamoDB can be issued in PartiQL using [this handler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ql-reference.html).
