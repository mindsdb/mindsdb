This is the implementation of the Redshift data handler for MindsDB.

[Amazon Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/welcome.html) is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud. You can start with just a few hundred gigabytes of data and scale to a petabyte or more, enabling you to use your data to acquire new insights for your business and customers.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using the `redshift_connector` library that is provided by Amazon Web Services.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `host` is the host name or IP address of the Redshift cluster.
* `port` is the port to use when connecting with the Redshift cluster.
* `database` is the database name to use when connecting with the Redshift cluster.
* `user` is the username to authenticate the user with the Redshift cluster.
* `password` is the password to authenticate the user with the Redshift cluster.
<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you must manually install all handler dependencies. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/redshift_handler) and run the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

Before attempting to connect the Redshift database to MindsDB, ensure that it accepts incoming connections. Here is a [guide](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cannot-connect-redshift-cluster) for troubleshooting Redshift database connections.

To connect to the Redshift database in MindsDB using this handler, use the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE redshift_datasource
WITH
  engine = 'redshift',
  parameters = {
    "host": "examplecluster.abc123xyz789.us-west-1.redshift.amazonaws.com",
    "port": 5439,
    "database": "example_db",
    "user": "awsuser",
    "password": "my_password"
  };
```

Once this connection has been established, you can query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM redshift_datasource.example_tbl;
```
