This is the implementation of Apache Doris data handler for MindsDB.

[Apache Doris](https://doris.apache.org/) provides high-performance hybrid search capabilities across structured data, semi-structured data (such as JSON), and vector data. It excels at delivering high-concurrency, low-latency queries, while also offering advanced optimization for complex join operations. In addition, Doris can serve as a unified query engine, delivering high-performance analytical services not only on its self-managed internal table format but also on open lakehouse formats such as Iceberg.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To connect Apache Doris to MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
3. Install or ensure access to Apache Doris.

## Connection

Use the following SQL to establish a connection to Apache Doris from MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE doris_conn
WITH ENGINE = 'apache_doris',
PARAMETERS = {
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 9030,
  "user": "doris_user",
  "password": "doris_pwd",
  "database": "doris_database"
};
```
The following parameters are required:

* `host` is Apache Doris Frontend node address.
* `port` is the query port of Apache Doris Frontend.
* `user` is Apache Doris user.
* `password` is Apache Doris password.
* `database` is Apache Doris database name.

Then, you can query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM doris_conn.demo_table
LIMIT 10;
```
