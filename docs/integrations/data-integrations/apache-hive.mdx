This is the implementation of the Hive data handler for MindsDB.

[Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/) is a data warehouse software project built on top of Apache Hadoop for providing data query and analysis. Hive gives an SQL-like interface to query data stored in various databases and file systems that integrate with Hadoop.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using the `pyHive`, a Python library that allows you to use Python code to run SQL commands on Hive.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `user` is the username associated with the database.
* `password` is the password to authenticate your access.
* `host` is the server IP address or hostname.
* `port` is the port through which TCP/IP connection is to be made.
* `database` is the database name to be connected.
* `auth` defaults to `CUSTOM` if not provided. Check for other options in [here](https://pypi.org/project/PyHive/).

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/hive_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the Hive database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE hive_datasource
WITH
  engine = 'hive',
  parameters = {
    "user": "demo_user",
    "password": "demo_password",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": "10000",
    "database": "default"
  };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hive_datasource.table_name;
```

<Tip>
To install `pyHive`, the following Linux packages are required:
- libsasl2-dev 
- sasl2-bin 
- libsasl2-2 
- libsasl2-dev 
- libsasl2-modules 
- libsasl2-modules-gssapi-mit
</Tip>
