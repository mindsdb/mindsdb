This is the implementation of the Apache Ignite data handler for MindsDB.

[Apache Ignite](https://ignite.apache.org/docs/latest/) is a distributed database for high-performance computing with in-memory speed.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To connect Apache Ignite to MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
3. Install or ensure access to Apache Ignite.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using the `pyignite` library, the Apache Ignite thin (binary protocol) client for Python.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `host` is the host name or IP address of the Apache Ignite cluster's node.
* `port` is the TCP/IP port of the Apache Ignite cluster's node. Must be an integer.

There are several optional arguments that can be used as well,

* `username` is the username used to authenticate with the Apache Ignite cluster. This parameter is optional. Default: None.
* `password` is the password to authenticate the user with the Apache Ignite cluster. This parameter is optional. Default: None.
* `schema` is the schema to use for the connection to the Apache Ignite cluster. This parameter is optional. Default: PUBLIC.

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to an Apache Ignite database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE ignite_datasource
WITH
    ENGINE = 'ignite',
    PARAMETERS = {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 10800,
        "username": "admin",
        "password": "password",
        "schema": "example_schema"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM ignite_datasource.demo_table
LIMIT 10;
```

<Tip>
Currently, a connection can be established only to a single node in the cluster. In the future, we'll configure the client to automatically fail over to another node if the connection to the current node fails or times out by providing the hosts and ports for many nodes as explained [here](https://ignite.apache.org/docs/latest/thin-clients/python-thin-client).
