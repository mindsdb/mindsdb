This is the implementation of the Impala data handler for MindsDB.

[Apache Impala](https://impala.apache.org/) is an MPP (Massive Parallel Processing) SQL query engine for processing huge volumes of data that is stored in the Apache Hadoop cluster. It is an open source software written in C++ and Java. It provides high performance and low latency compared to other SQL engines for Hadoop. In other words, Impala is the highest performing SQL engine (giving RDBMS-like experience) that provides the fastest way to access data stored in Hadoop Distributed File System.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To connect Apache Impala to MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
3. Install or ensure access to Apache Impala.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using `impyla`, a Python library that allows you to use Python code to run SQL commands on Impala.

The required arguments to establish a connection are:

* `user` is the username associated with the database.
* `password` is the password to authenticate your access.
* `host` is the server IP address or hostname.
* `port` is the port through which TCP/IP connection is to be made.
* `database` is the database name to be connected.

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the Impala database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE impala_datasource
WITH
  engine = 'impala',
  parameters = {
    "user":"root",
    "password":"p@55w0rd",
    "host":"127.0.0.1",
    "port":21050,
    "database":"Db_NamE"
  };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM impala_datasource.TEST;
```
