This is the implementation of the CrateDB data handler for MindsDB.

[CrateDB](https://crate.io/) is a distributed SQL database management system that integrates a fully searchable document-oriented data store. It is open-source, written in Java, based on a shared-nothing architecture, and designed for high scalability. CrateDB includes components from Lucene, Elasticsearch and Netty.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To connect CrateDB to MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
3. Install or ensure access to CrateDB.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using `crate`, a Python library that allows you to use Python code to run SQL commands on CrateDB.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `user` is the username associated with the database.
* `password` is the password to authenticate your access.
* `host` is the hostname or IP adress of the server.
* `port` is the port through which connection is to be made.
* `schema_name` is schema name to get tables from. Defaults to `doc`.

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the CrateDB database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE crate_datasource
WITH
    engine = 'crate',
    parameters = {
        "user": "crate",
        "password": "",
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 4200,
        "schema_name": "doc"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM crate_datasource.demo;
```
