This is the implementation of the D0lt data handler for MindsDB.

[D0lt](https://docs.dolthub.com/introduction/what-is-dolt) is a single-node and embedded DBMS that incorporates Git-style versioning as a first-class entity. D0lt behaves like Git - it is a content-addressable local database where the main objects are tables instead of files. In D0lt, a user creates a database locally. The database contains tables that can be read and updated using SQL. Similar to Git, writes are staged until the user issues a commit. Upon commit, the writes are appended to permanent storage.

Branch and merge semantics are supported allowing for the tables to evolve at a different pace for multiple users. This allows for loose collaboration on data as well as multiple views on the same core data. Merge conflicts are detected for schema and data conflicts. Data conflicts are cell-based, not line-based. Remote repositories allow for cooperation among repository instances. Clone, push, and pull semantics are all available.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To connect D0lt to MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
3. Install or ensure access to D0lt.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using `mysql-connector`, a Python library that allows you to use Python code to run SQL commands on the D0lt database.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `user` is the username associated with the database.
* `password` is the password to authenticate your access.
* `host` is the hostname or IP address of the server.
* `port` is the port through which a TCP/IP connection is to be made.
* `database` is the database name to be connected.

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the D0lt database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE d0lt_datasource
WITH
    engine = 'd0lt',
    parameters = {
        "user": "root",
        "password": "",
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 3306,
        "database": "information_schema"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM D0lt_datasource.TEST;
```
