This is the implementation of the Databend data handler for MindsDB.

[Databend](https://databend.rs/) is a modern cloud data warehouse that empowers your object storage for real-time analytics.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented by extending the ClickHouse handler.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `protocol` is the protocol to query Databend. Supported values include `native`, `http`, `https`. It defaults to `native` if not provided.
* `host` is the host name or IP address of the Databend warehouse.
* `port` is the TCP/IP port of the Databend warehouse.
* `user` is the username used to authenticate with the Databend warehouse.
* `password` is the password to authenticate the user with the Databend warehouse.
* `database` is the database name to use when connecting with the Databend warehouse.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/databend_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the Databend database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE databend_datasource
WITH
    engine = 'databend',
    parameters = {
        "protocol": "https",
        "user": "root",
        "port": 443,
        "password": "password",
        "host": "some-url.aws-us-east-2.default.databend.com",
        "database": "test_db"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM databend_datasource.example_tbl;
```
