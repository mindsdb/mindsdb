This is the implementation of the EdgelessDB data handler for MindsDB.

[Edgeless](https://edgeless.systems/) is a full SQL database, tailor-made for confidential computing. It seamlessly integrates with your existing tools and workflows to help you unlock the full potential of your data.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To connect EdgelessDB to MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
3. Install or ensure access to EdgelessDB.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented by extending the MySQL connector.
The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `host`: the host name of the EdgelessDB connection
* `port`: the port to use when connecting
* `user`: the user to authenticate
* `password`: the password to authenticate the user
* `database`: database name

To use the full potensial of EdgelessDB, you can also specify the following arguments:

* `ssl`: whether to use SSL or not
* `ssl_ca`: path or url to the CA certificate
* `ssl_cert`: path or url to the client certificate
* `ssl_key`: path or url to the client key

## Usage

In order to use EdgelessDB as a data source in MindsDB, you need to use the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE edgelessdb_datasource
    WITH ENGINE = "EdgelessDB",
    PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "root",
    "password": "test123@!Aabvhj",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 3306,
    "database": "test_schema"
    }
```
Or you can use the following syntax:

```sql

CREATE DATABASE edgelessdb_datasource2
    WITH ENGINE = "EdgelessDB",
    PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "root",
    "password": "test123@!Aabvhj",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 3306,
    "database": "test_schema",
    "ssl_cert": "/home/marios/demo/cert.pem",
    "ssl_key": "/home/marios/demo/key.pem"
    }
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM edgelessdb_datasource.table_name
```
