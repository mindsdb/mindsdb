This is the implementation of the GreptimeDB data handler for MindsDB.

[GreptimeDB](https://greptime.com/) is an open-source, cloud-native time series database features analytical capabilities, scalebility and open protocols support.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented by extending the MySQLHandler.

Connect GreptimeDB to MindsDB by providing the following parameters:

* `host` is the host name, IP address, or URL.
* `port` is the port used to make TCP/IP connection.
* `database` is the database name.
* `user` is the database user.
* `password` is the database password.

There are several optional parameters that can be used as well.

* `ssl` is the `ssl` parameter value that indicates whether SSL is enabled (`True`) or disabled (`False`).
* `ssl_ca` is the SSL Certificate Authority.
* `ssl_cert` stores SSL certificates.
* `ssl_key` stores SSL keys.

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the GreptimeDB database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE greptimedb_datasource
WITH
  engine = 'greptimedb',
  parameters = {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 4002,
    "database": "public",
    "user": "username",
    "password": "password"
  };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM greptimedb_datasource.example_table;
```
