This is the implementation of the InfluxDB data handler for MindsDB.

[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) is a time series database that can be used to collect data and monitor the system and devices, especially Edge devices.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To connect InfluxDB to MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
3. Install or ensure access to InfluxDB.

## Implementation

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `influxdb_url` is the hosted URL of InfluxDB Cloud.
* `influxdb_token` is the authentication token for the hosted InfluxDB Cloud instance.
* `influxdb_db_name` is the database name of the InfluxDB Cloud instance.
* `influxdb_table_name` is the table name of the InfluxDB Cloud instance.

<Tip>
Please follow [this link](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/cloud/security/tokens/create-token/#create-a-token-in-the-influxdb-ui) to generate token for accessing InfluxDB API.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the InfluxDB database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE influxdb_source
WITH
    ENGINE = 'influxdb',
    PARAMETERS = {
        "influxdb_url": "<influxdb-hosted-url>",
        "influxdb_token": "<api-key-token",
        "influxdb_db_name": "<database-name>",
        "influxdb_table_name": "<table-name>"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows.

```sql
SELECT name, time, sensor_id, temperature
FROM influxdb_source.tables
ORDER BY temperature DESC
LIMIT 65;
```
