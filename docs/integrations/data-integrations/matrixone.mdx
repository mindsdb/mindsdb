This is the implementation of the MatrixOne data handler for MindsDB.

[MatrixOne](https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone) is a future-oriented hyper-converged cloud and edge native DBMS that supports transactional, analytical, and streaming workloads with a simplified and distributed database engine, across multiple data centers, clouds, edges, and other heterogeneous infrastructures.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To connect MatrixOne to MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
3. Install or ensure access to MatrixOne.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using `PyMySQL`, a Python library that allows you to use Python code to run SQL commands on the MatrixOne database.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `user` is the username associated with the database.
* `password` is the password to authenticate your access.
* `host` is the hostname or IP address of the database.
* `port` is the port through which TCP/IP connection is to be made.
* `database` is the database name to be connected.

There are several optional arguments that can be used as well.

* `ssl` indicates whether SSL is enabled (`True`) or disabled (`False`).
* `ssl_ca` is the SSL Certificate Authority.
* `ssl_cert` stores the SSL certificates.
* `ssl_key` stores the SSL keys.

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the MatrixOne database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE matrixone_datasource
WITH
    engine = 'matrixone',
    parameters = {
        "user": "dump",
        "password": "111",
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 6001,
        "database": "mo_catalog"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Matrixone_datasource.demo;
```
