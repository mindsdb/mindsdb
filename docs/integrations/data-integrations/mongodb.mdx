This is the implementation of the MongoDB data handler for MindsDB.

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is an open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. It is classified as a NoSQL database.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To connect MongoDB to MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
3. Install or ensure access to MongoDB.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using `pymongo`, a Python library that contains tools for working with the MongoDB database.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `host` is the MongoDB connection string.

Optionally, you can connect using these parameters:

* `username` is the username associated with the database.
* `password` is the password to authenticate your access.
* `host` is the host name or IP address.
* `port` is the port through which TCP/IP connection is to be made.
* `database` is the database name to be connected. Note, this will be required if the connection string is missing the `/database` path.

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the MongoDB database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mongo_datasource
WITH
  ENGINE = 'mongodb',
  PARAMETERS = {
    "host": "mongodb+srv://admin:admin@demo.mongodb.net/public"
  };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mongo_datasource.demo;
```

<Warning>
**For this connection, we strongly suggest using the Mongo API instead of the SQL API.**

MindsDB has a dedicated [Mongo API](/sdks/mongo/mindsdb-mongo-ql-overview) that allows you to use the full power of the MindsDB platform.
Using the Mongo API feels more natural for MongoDB users and allows you to use all the features of MindsDB.

You can find the instructions on how to connect MindsDB to [MongoDB Compass](/connect/mongo-compass) or [MongoDB Shell](/connect/mongo-shell) and proceed with the [Mongo API documentation](/sdks/mongo/mindsdb-mongo-ql-overview) for further details.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Once you connected MindsDB to MongoDB Compass or MongoDB Shell, you can run this command to connect your database to MindsDB:

```sql
test> use mindsdb
mindsdb> db.databases.insertOne({
              name: "mongo_datasource",
              engine: "mongodb",
              connection_args: {
                      "host": "mongodb+srv://user:pass@db.xxxyyy.mongodb.net/"
              }
          });
```

Then you can query your data, like this:

```sql
mindsdb> use mongo_datasource
mongo_datasource> db.demo.find({}).limit(3)
```
