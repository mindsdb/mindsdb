This is the implementation of the QuestDB data handler for MindsDB.

[QuestDB](https://questdb.io/) is a columnar time-series database with high performance ingestion and SQL analytics. It is open-source and available on the cloud.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented by extending the PostgreSQL data handler.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `user` is the database user.
* `password` is the database password.
* `host` is the host name, IP address, or URL.
* `port` is the port used to make TCP/IP connection.
* `database` is the database name.
* `public` stores a value of `True` or `False`. Defaults to `True` if left blank.
<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/questdb_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>
## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the QuestDB server in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE questdb_datasource
WITH
  ENGINE = 'questdb',
  PARAMETERS = {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 8812,
    "database": "qdb",
    "user": "admin",
    "password": "password"
  };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM questdb_datasource.demo_table
LIMIT 10;
```
