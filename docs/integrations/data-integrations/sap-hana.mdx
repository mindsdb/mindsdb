This is the implementation of the SAP HANA data handler for MindsDB.

[SAP HANA](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/hana/what-is-sap-hana.html), where HANA stands for High-performance ANalytic Appliance, is a multi-model database that stores data in its memory instead of keeping it on a disk. The column-oriented in-memory database design used by SAP HANA allows users to run advanced analytics alongside high-speed transactions in a single system.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To connect SAP HANA to MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
3. Install or ensure access to SAP HANA.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using `hdbcli`, the Python driver for SAP HANA.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `host` is the host name or IP address of the SAP HANA instance.
* `port` is the port number of the SAP HANA instance.
* `user` specifies the user name.
* `password` specifies the password for the user.
* `schema` sets the current schema, which is used for identifiers without a defined schema.

## Usage

You can use the below SQL statements to create a schema in SAP HANA called `MINDSDB` and a table called `TEST`.

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA MINDSDB;

CREATE TABLE MINDSDB.TEST
(
    ID          INTEGER NOT NULL,
    NAME        NVARCHAR(1),
    DESCRIPTION NVARCHAR(1)
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX MINDSDB.TEST_ID_INDEX
    ON MINDSDB.TEST (ID);

ALTER TABLE MINDSDB.TEST
    ADD CONSTRAINT TEST_PK
        PRIMARY KEY (ID);

INSERT INTO MINDSDB.TEST
VALUES (1, 'h', 'w');
```

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the SAP HANA database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE sap_hana_trial
WITH
    ENGINE = 'hana',
    PARAMETERS = {
        "user": "DBADMIN",
        "password": "password",
        "host": "<uuid>.hana.trial-us10.hanacloud.ondemand.com",
        "port": "443",
        "schema": "MINDSDB",
        "encrypt": true
    };
```

<Note>
The above example assumes usage of SAP HANA Cloud, which requires the `encrypt` parameter to be set to `true` and uses port `443`.
</Note>

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sap_hana_trial.test;
```

On execution, we get:

| ID  | NAME | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | ---- | ----------- |
| 1   | h    | w           |
