This is the implementation of the ScyllaDB data handler for MindsDB.

[ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/) is an open-source distributed NoSQL wide-column data store. It was purposefully designed to offer compatibility with Apache Cassandra while outperforming it with higher throughputs and reduced latencies. For a comprehensive understanding of ScyllaDB, visit ScyllaDB's official website.

### Implementation

The ScyllaDB handler for MindsDB was developed using the scylla-driver library for Python.
The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `host`: Host name or IP address of ScyllaDB.
* `port`: Connection port.
* `user`: Authentication username.
* `password`: Authentication password.
* `keyspace`: The specific keyspace (top-level container for tables) to connect to.
* `protocol_version`: Optional. Defaults to 4.
* `secure_connect_bundle`: Optional. Needed only for connections to DataStax Astra.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/scylla_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage 

To set up a connection between MindsDB and a Scylla server, utilize the following SQL syntax:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE scylladb_datasource
WITH
  ENGINE = 'scylladb',
  PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "user@mindsdb.com",
    "password": "pass",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": "9042",
    "keyspace": "test_data"
  };
```
<Tip>
The protocol version is set to 4 by default. Should you wish to modify it, simply include "protocol_version": 5 within the PARAMETERS dictionary in the query above.
</Tip>

With the connection established, you can execute queries on your keyspace as demonstrated below:

```sql
SELECT * FROM scylladb_datasource.keystore.example_table LIMIT 10;
```
