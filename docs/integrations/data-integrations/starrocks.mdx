This is the implementation of the StarRocks data handler for MindsDB.

[StarRocks](https://www.starrocks.io/) is the next-generation data platform designed to make data-intensive real-time analytics fast and easy. It delivers query speeds 5 to 10 times faster than other popular solutions. StarRocks can perform real-time analytics well while updating historical records. It can also enhance real-time analytics with historical data from data lakes easily. With StarRocks, you can get rid of the de-normalized tables and get the best performance and flexibility.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To connect StarRocks to MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
3. Install or ensure access to StarRocks.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented by extending the MySQL data handler.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `user` is the database user.
* `password` is the database password.
* `host` is the host name, IP address, or URL.
* `port` is the port used to make TCP/IP connection.
* `database` is the database name.

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the StarRocks server in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE starrocks_datasource
WITH
  ENGINE = 'starrocks',
  PARAMETERS = {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "user": "starrocks_user",
    "password": "password",
    "port": 8030,
    "database": "starrocks_db"
  };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM starrocks_datasource.demo_table
LIMIT 10;
```
