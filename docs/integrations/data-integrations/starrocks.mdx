This is the implementation of the StarRocks data handler for MindsDB.

[StarRocks](https://www.starrocks.io/) is the next-generation data platform designed to make data-intensive real-time analytics fast and easy. It delivers query speeds 5 to 10 times faster than other popular solutions. StarRocks can perform real-time analytics well while updating historical records. It can also enhance real-time analytics with historical data from data lakes easily. With StarRocks, you can get rid of the de-normalized tables and get the best performance and flexibility.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented by extending the MySQL data handler.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `user` is the database user.
* `password` is the database password.
* `host` is the host name, IP address, or URL.
* `port` is the port used to make TCP/IP connection.
* `database` is the database name.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/starrocks_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the StarRocks server in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE starrocks_datasource
WITH
  ENGINE = 'starrocks',
  PARAMETERS = {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "user": "starrocks_user",
    "password": "password",
    "port": 8030,
    "database": "starrocks_db"
  };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM starrocks_datasource.demo_table
LIMIT 10;
```
