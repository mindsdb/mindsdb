This is the implementation of the YugabyteDB data handler for MindsDB.

[YugabyteDB](https://www.yugabyte.com/) is a high-performance, cloud-native distributed SQL database that aims to support all PostgreSQL features. It is best fit for cloud-native OLTP (i.e. real-time, business-critical) applications that need absolute data correctness and require at least one of the following: scalability, high tolerance to failures, or globally-distributed deployments.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using `psycopg2`, a Python library that allows you to use Python code to run SQL commands on the YugabyteDB database.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

- `user` is the database user.
- `password` is the database password.
- `host` is the host name, IP address, or URL.
- `port` is the port used to make TCP/IP connection.
- `database` is the database name.
- `schema` is the schema to which your table belongs.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/yugabyte_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the YugabyteDB database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE yugabyte_datasource
WITH
    engine = 'yugabyte',
    parameters = {
        "user": "admin",
        "password": "1234",
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 5433,
        "database": "yugabyte",
        "schema": "your_schema_name"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM yugabyte_datasource.demo;
```

<Note>
NOTE : If you are using YugabyteDB Cloud with MindsDB Cloud website you need to add below 3 static IPs of MindsDB Cloud to `allow IP list` for accessing it publicly.
