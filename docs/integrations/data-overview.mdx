MindsDB integrates with numerous data sources, including databases, vector stores, and applications, making data available to AI agents and apps by connecting data sources to MindsDB.

MindsDB supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) where MindsDB is an MCP server that enables your MCP applications to answer questions over large-scale federated data. [Learn more here](/mcp/overview).

<Note>
Note that MindsDB doesn't store or copy your data. Instead, it fetches data directly from your connected sources each time you make a query, ensuring that any changes to the data are instantly reflected. This means your data remains in its original location, and MindsDB always works with the most up-to-date information.

## Community Integrations

Integrations developed by the MindsDB community. They may offer valuable functionality but are not officially supported and may have limited feature coverage or known issues.

All remaining integrations available in the documentation sections below and in the [handlers folder](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/tree/main/mindsdb/integrations/handlers) are considered community integrations.

<Tip>
If you don't find a data source of your interest, you can [request a feature here](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request_v2.yaml) or build a handler following [this instruction for data handlers](/contribute/data-handlers) and [this instruction for applications](/contribute/app-handlers).
</Tip>

<Info>
Here is how you can query for all the available data handlers used to connect data sources to MindsDB.

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM information_schema.handlers WHERE type = 'data';
  --or
  SHOW HANDLERS WHERE type = 'data';
  ```
