You can upload TXT files of any size to MindsDB that runs locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [pip](/contribute/install).

TXT files are divided into chunks and stored in multiple table cells. MindsDB uses the [TextLoader from LangChain](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.text.TextLoader.html) to load TXT files.
