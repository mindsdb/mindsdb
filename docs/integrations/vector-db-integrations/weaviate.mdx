This is the implementation of the Weaviate for MindsDB.

## Weaviate

Weaviate is an open-source vector database. It allows you to store data objects and vector embeddings from your favorite ML-models, and scale seamlessly into billions of data objects.
_
## Implementation

This handler uses `weaviate-client` python library connect to a weaviate instance.

The required arguments to establish a connection are:

* `weaviate_url`: url of the weaviate database
* `weaviate_api_key`: API key to authenticate with weaviate (in case of cloud instance).
* `persistence_directory`: directory to be used in case of local storage


### Creating connection

In order to make use of this handler and connect to a Weaviate server in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE weaviate_datasource
            WITH ENGINE = "weaviate",
            PARAMETERS = {
                "weaviate_url" : "https://sample.weaviate.network",
                "weaviate_api_key": "api-key"
};
```

```sql
CREATE DATABASE weaviate_datasource
            WITH ENGINE = "weaviate",
            PARAMETERS = {
                "weaviate_url" : "https://localhost:8080",
};
```

```sql
CREATE DATABASE weaviate_datasource
            WITH ENGINE = "weaviate",
            PARAMETERS = {
                "persistence_directory" : "db_path",
};
```

### Dropping connection

To drop the connection, use this command

```sql
DROP DATABASE weaviate_datasource;
```

### Creating tables

To insert data from a pre-existing table, use `CREATE`

```sql
CREATE TABLE weaviate_datascource.test
(SELECT * FROM sqlitedb.test);
```
As weaviate currently doesn't support json field. 
So, this creates another table for the "metadata" field and a reference is created in the original table which points to
its metadata entry.

Weaviate follows GraphQL conventions where classes (which are table schemas) start with a capital letter and 
properties start with a lowercase letter.

So whenever we create a table, the table's name gets capitalized.

### Dropping collections

To drop a Weaviate table use this command

```sql
DROP TABLE weaviate_datasource.tablename;
```

### Querying and selecting

To query database using a search vector, you can use `search_vector` or `embeddings` in `WHERE` clause

```sql
SELECT * from weaviate_datasource.test
WHERE search_vector = '[3.0, 1.0, 2.0, 4.5]'
LIMIT 10;
```

Basic query 

```sql
SELECT * from weaviate_datasource.test
```

You can use `WHERE` clause on dynamic fields like normal SQL

```sql
SELECT * FROM weaviate_datasource.createtest
WHERE category = "science";
```

### Deleting records

You can delete entries using `DELETE` just like in SQL.


```sql
DELETE FROM weaviate_datasource.test
WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3);
```
