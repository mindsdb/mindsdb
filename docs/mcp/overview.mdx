The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol designed to enable real-time communication between MindsDB and client applications for model training and inference. MCP runs on port 47337 by default.

## Getting Started

To enable the MCP API, you can:

1. Use the `MINDSDB_APIS` environment variable:
```bash
export MINDSDB_APIS='http,mysql,mongodb,postgres,mcp'
```

2. Or specify it when starting MindsDB:
```bash
python -m mindsdb --api http,mysql,mongodb,postgres,mcp
```

## Protocol Overview

MCP provides a bidirectional communication channel that allows clients to Run queries over federated data 

FEDERATED DATA: Is data that is stored in different databases and/or different cloud providers.

MindsDB MCP API allows you to query federated data as if it were a single database.


## How it works

Once you have MindsDB running, you can connect all your databases and query them as if they were a single database.
Then you can plug those databases to your AI applications/clients that use the MCP API.

1. The client connects to the MCP API
2. The client sends a query to the MCP API
3. The MCP API sends the query to the federated data source
4. The federated data source returns the results to the MCP API
5. The MCP API returns the results to the client
