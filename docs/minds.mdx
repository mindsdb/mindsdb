Minds are advanced AI systems designed to answer questions across connected data sources, providing comprehensive insights while reducing the time and effort needed for manual data analysis.

Minds function similarly to **large language models (LLMs) but go beyond** by answering queries using any connected data. This is achieved through:

* **parametric search** to retrieve the most relevant data.
* **semantic search** to understand context and generate meaningful responses.
* **AI/ML models** to analyze data and deliver precise answers.

With Minds, one can seamlessly integrate AI-powered enterprise knowledge into applications. By creating a Mind, connecting data sources, and making queries via Minds' OpenAI-compatible APIs, applications gain expert-like intelligence, orchestrating across multiple knowledge sources to provide well-reasoned answers.
