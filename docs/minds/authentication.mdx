Authenticate your requests to access the endpoints in the Minds Cloud. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Minds Dashboard](https://mdb.ai/apiKeys).

Here's how to add the Minds API key to the request header using cURL or Minds SDK, which you can install by running `pip install minds_sdk`.

<CodeGroup>
    ```bash cURL
    curl --request X \
    --url 'https://mdb.ai/...' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer MINDS_API_KEY'
    ...
    ```

    ```python Python
    from minds.client import Client

    client = Client("MINDS_API_KEY")
    ```
</CodeGroup>

Always keep your API keys safe and revoke it if you suspect it has been compromised.
