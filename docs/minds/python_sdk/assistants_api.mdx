Once the Mind is created, you can chat with the Mind using the OpenAI-compatible Assistants API. Therefore to follow this code, if you havenâ€™t already, install the OpenAI SDK by running `pip install openai`, and use the Minds API key and name of the Mind you created.

The following code lets you have conversations with the Mind, create threads, messages, and runs.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

your_minds_api_key = <YOUR API KEY>
mind_name = <NAME YOU GAVE TO YOUR MIND>

# point the Openai SDK to the Minds Cloud
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=your_minds_api_key,
    base_url='https://mdb.ai/'
)

# print the message before making the API request
print('Answering the question may take up to 30 seconds...')

thread = client.beta.threads.create()

message = client.beta.threads.messages.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    role="user",
    content="How many 2-bedroom houses are on the market?"
)

# run the message on the mind that you created
run = client.beta.threads.runs.create_and_poll(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    assistant_id=mind_name
)

if run.status == 'completed':
    messages = client.beta.threads.messages.list(
      thread_id=thread.id
    )
    print(messages.data[1].role + ': ' + messages.data[1].content[0].text.value)
    print(messages.data[0].role + ': ' + messages.data[0].content[0].text.value)
else:
    print(run.status)

client.beta.threads.delete(thread.id)
```

Here is the output:

```
Answering the question may take up to 30 seconds...
user: How many 2-bedroom houses are on the market?
assistant: There are 99 two-bedroom houses that were once on the market according to the data in the database.
```

### Stream Mind's Thoughts

This feature enables you to stream the thoughts of the Mind, which includes all the steps the Mind takes to answer the question.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

your_minds_api_key = <YOUR API KEY>
mind_name = <NAME YOU GAVE TO YOUR MIND>

# point the Openai SDK to the Minds Cloud
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=your_minds_api_key,
    base_url='https://mdb.ai/'
)

# create an EventHandler class to define how to handle the events in the response stream
from typing_extensions import override
from openai import AssistantEventHandler
 
class EventHandler(AssistantEventHandler):    
  @override
  def on_text_created(self, text) -> None:
    print(f"\nassistant > ", end="", flush=True)
      
  @override
  def on_text_delta(self, delta, snapshot):
    print(delta.value, end="", flush=True)
      
  def on_tool_call_created(self, tool_call):
    print(f"\nassistant > {tool_call.type}\n", flush=True)
  
  def on_tool_call_delta(self, delta, snapshot):
    if delta.type == 'code_interpreter':
      if delta.code_interpreter.input:
        print(delta.code_interpreter.input, end="", flush=True)
      if delta.code_interpreter.outputs:
        print(f"\n\noutput >", flush=True)
        for output in delta.code_interpreter.outputs:
          if output.type == "logs":
            print(f"\n{output.logs}", flush=True)

# create a conversation thread
thread = client.beta.threads.create()

# chat with the Mind you created
while True:
    user_input = input("Enter your message (type 'exit' to quit): ")
    if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
        break

    print('Answering the question may take up to 30 seconds...')

    message = client.beta.threads.messages.create(
        thread_id=thread.id,
        role='user',
        content=user_input
    )

    # stream the response
    with client.beta.threads.runs.stream(
      thread_id=thread.id,
      assistant_id=mind.name,
      event_handler=EventHandler(),
    ) as stream:
      stream.until_done()

client.beta.threads.delete(thread.id)
```

Here is the output:

assistant > I understand your request. I'm working on a detailed response for you.Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes
Action: sql_db_list_tables
Action Input: ""unique_data_source_name.house_salesTo determine how many three-bedroom houses were sold in 2008, I need to examine the schema of the `house_sales` table to identify the relevant columns for bedrooms and sale date. 

Action: sql_db_schema
Action Input: unique_data_source_name.house_salesTable named `house_sales`

/* Sample with first 3 rows from table unique_data_source_name.house_sales:
saledate        ma      type    bedrooms        created_at

2008-03-31      441854  house   2       2007-02-25 19:23:52.585358
*/
Column data types: `saledate` : `date`, `ma` : `integer`,       `type` : `text`,        `bedrooms` : `integer`, `created_at` : `timestamp without time zone`
To find out how many three-bedroom houses were sold in 2008, I will query the `house_sales` table using the `bedrooms` and `saledate` columns. 

Let's proceed with the query to get the count of three-bedroom houses sold in 2008.

Action: mindsdb_sql_parser_tool
Action Input: 
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM unique_data_source_name.house_sales 
WHERE bedrooms = 3 
AND saledate::DATE BETWEEN '2008-01-01' AND '2008-12-31'
```valid query: SELECT count(*) FROM unique_data_source_name.house_sales WHERE bedrooms = 3 AND CAST(saledate AS DATE) BETWEEN '2008-01-01' AND '2008-12-31'To find the number of three-bedroom houses sold in 2008, I will execute the validated query.

Action: sql_db_query
Action Input: 
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM unique_data_source_name.house_sales 
WHERE bedrooms = 3 
AND saledate::DATE BETWEEN '2008-01-01' AND '2008-12-31'
```Output columns: 'count'
Result: 8
The number of three-bedroom houses sold in 2008 was 8.
```
