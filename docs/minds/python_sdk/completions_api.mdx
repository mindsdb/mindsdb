Once the Mind is created, you can chat with the Mind using the OpenAI-compatible Completions API. Therefore to follow this code, if you havenâ€™t already, install the OpenAI SDK by running `pip install openai`, and use the Minds API key and name of the Mind you created.

The following code lets you chat with your Mind.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

your_minds_api_key = <YOUR API KEY>
mind_name = <NAME YOU GAVE TO YOUR MIND>

# point the Openai SDK to the Minds Cloud
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=your_minds_api_key,
    base_url='https://mdb.ai/'
)

# print the message before making the API request
print('Answering the question may take up to 30 seconds...')

# chat with the Mind you created
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=mind_name,
    messages=[
        {'role': 'user', 'content': 'How many three-bedroom houses were sold in 2008?'}
    ],
    stream=False
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

Alternatively, continue using the Minds SDK to access the OpenAI-compatible Completions API by calling the `completion` function on the `mind` object.

```python
print(mind.completion('How many three-bedroom houses were sold in 2008?', stream=False))
```

Here is the output:

```
There were 8 three-bedroom houses sold in 2008.
```

### Stream Mind's Thoughts

This feature enables you to stream the thoughts of the Mind, which includes all the steps the Mind takes to answer the question.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

your_minds_api_key = <YOUR API KEY>
mind_name = <NAME YOU GAVE TO YOUR MIND>

# point the Openai SDK to the Minds Cloud
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=your_minds_api_key,
    base_url='https://mdb.ai/'
)

# print the message before making the API request
print('Answering the question may take up to 30 seconds...')

# chat with the Mind you created
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=mind_name,
    messages=[
        {'role': 'user', 'content': 'How many three-bedroom houses were sold in 2008?'}
    ],
    stream=True
)

# print output in the form of chunks
for chunk in completion:
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content)
    print()
```

Alternatively, continue using the Minds SDK to access the OpenAI-compatible Completions API by calling the `completion` function on the `mind` object.

```python
for chunk in mind.completion('How many three-bedroom houses were sold in 2008?', stream=True):
	print(chunk.content)
```

Here is the output:

I understand your request. I'm working on a detailed response for you.
