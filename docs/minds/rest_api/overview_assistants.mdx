Assistants enable Minds to engage in conversational interactions, keeping track of the conversational context. This contrasts with the [Chat Completions endpoint](/docs/api/chat#completions), which handles one-time requests without *remembering* past interactions.

Hereâ€™s how to use **Minds as Assistants**:

1. [Create a conversation Thread](/docs/api/assistants_threads#create-thread) and save the Thread ID.
2. [Create a Message](/docs/api/assistants_messages#create-message) assigning it to the Thread. This is a question sent to the Mind.
3. [List Messages](/docs/api/assistants_messages#list-messages) assigned to the Thread to ensure your message has been sent.
4. [Create a Run](/docs/api/assistants_runs#create-run) assigning it to the Thread and providing the name of the [Mind created with this endpoint](/docs/api/minds#create-mind), and save the Run ID.
5. [Retrieve a Run](/docs/api/assistants_runs#retrieve-run) assigned to the Thread to check the status of the Run. The status should read complete.
6. [List Messages](/docs/api/assistants_messages#list-messages) assigned to the Thread that should contain the response from the Mind.
