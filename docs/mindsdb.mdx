Play with the [Minds demo](https://mdb.ai/register), and see the power of MindsDB at answering questions from structured to unstructured data, including data scattered across SaaS applications, databases, or data warehouses.

## Core Philosophy

MindsDB is built around three fundamental capabilities that form the foundation of MindsDB, enabling seamless integration, organization, and utilization of data.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect">
    Connect data from [hundreds of data sources](/integrations/data-overview) that integrate with MindsDB, including databases, data warehouses, applications, and vector databases.

    Learn more [here](/mindsdb-connect).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Unify">
    Unify data from multiple (structured and unstructured) data sources within MindsDB, enabling federated queries as if all data resides in a single database.

    Store the unified data into [views](/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/view) or [knowledge bases](/mindsdb_sql/knowledge-bases) to ensure easy access with no need for ETL.

    Automation features like [jobs](/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/jobs) and [triggers](/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/trigger) enable scheduling synchronization and transformation tasks for real-time data processing.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Respond">
    Generate accurate, context-aware responses from unified data using [agents](/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent) or [MCP API](/mcp/overview), making insights easily accessible across applications and teams.
