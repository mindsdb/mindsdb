Agents enable conversation with data, including structured and unstructured data connected to MindsDB.

Connect your data to MindsDB by [connecting databases or applications](/integrations/data-overview) or [uploading files](/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/file). Users can opt for using [knowledge bases](/mindsdb_sql/knowledge-bases) to store and retrieve data efficiently.

Create an agent, passing the connected data and defining the underlying model.

```sql
CREATE AGENT my_agent
USING
    model = {
        "provider": "openai",
        "model_name" : "gpt-4o",
        "api_key": "sk-abc123"
    },
    data = {
         "knowledge_bases": ["mindsdb.sales_kb", "mindsdb.orders_kb"],
         "tables": ["postgres_conn.customers", "mysql_conn.products"]
    },
    prompt_template='
        mindsdb.sales_kb stores sales analytics data
        mindsdb.orders_kb stores order data
        postgres_conn.customers stores customers data
        mysql_conn.products stores products data
    ';
```

Query an agent and ask question over the connected data.

```sql
SELECT answer
FROM my_agent 
WHERE question = 'What is the average number of orders per customers?';
```
