**MindsDB Agents** are part of the open-source MindsDB product and enable users to ask natural language questions over connected data sources. They provide intelligent querying capabilities across databases and knowledge bases directly within MindsDB.

For organizations with advanced requirements, **Minds** is the enterprise counterpart to MindsDB Agents. Minds extends the same core concept with enhanced capabilities, scalability, context management, and production-grade features.

## How MindsDB Agents Work

MindsDB Agents are built on the Pydantic framework and follow a structured workflow to interpret and answer user questions over the connected data.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Step 1. Input Processing">
When a query is received, the agent:
* Builds a real-time data catalog generated dynamically and based on a sample of 5 rows from each connected data object
* Extracts prompts and user messages
* Prepares structured input for reasoning
This lightweight catalog enables the agent to understand available schemas and data types.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 2. Planning">
Using the processed input, the agent:
* Determines which connected data sources are relevant
* Plans query execution steps
* Prepares SQL queries as needed
This stage ensures that the agent selects appropriate tables and avoids unnecessary exploration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 3. Exploration Loop">
The agent enters an iterative execution cycle:
* Executes queries against connected tables or knowledge bases
* Collects and evaluates results
* Adjusts queries if needed
This loop continues until sufficient relevant data is collected, up to a maximum of 20 queries.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 4. Error Handling & Learning">
If execution errors occur:
* Errors are analyzed
* The agent attempts corrective adjustments
* Up to three accumulated errors are retained for context
This iterative correction improves answer accuracy within session constraints.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 5. Output Synthesis">
Finally, the agent:
* Aggregates collected data
* Synthesizes a natural language or structured response
* Returns the answer based on the query format
</Accordion>

## Recommended Usage

To ensure optimal performance and accuracy, follow these guidelines.

1. **Data Preparation**

    High-quality input significantly improves agent performance.

    Clean your data:

    * Remove irrelevant columns
    * Filter unnecessary rows
    * Normalize inconsistent formats

    Create views to simplify the agent's reasoning:

    * Filtered views: Keep only relevant tables, columns, and rows
    * Aggregated views: Provide summary tables for frequent analytical queries
    * Joined views: Combine tables that are commonly queried together

    Well-designed views reduce cognitive load on the agent.

2. **Agent Data Setup**

    To maintain performance:

    * Limit connected objects (tables + knowledge bases) to 10 or fewer
    * Ensure objects are relevant to the use case
    * Provide descriptive context in the prompt

    Example of helpful context:

    * Describe data stored in connected tables or knowledge bases
    * Clarify relationships between available data objects
    * Specify expected output format

    The clearer the setup, the more accurate the agent's reasoning.

3. **Querying an Agent**

    Agent outputs are non-deterministic, due to the nature of large language models. However, MindsDB provides mechanisms for limited output control.

    To receive a natural language answer:

    ```sql
    SELECT answer 
    FROM agent_name 
    WHERE question = "What is the capital of France?";
    ```

    This ensures the agent returns a human-readable response contained in the `answer` column.

    To enforce a specific output structure:

    ```sql
    SELECT product_name, monthly_sales_count
    FROM agent_name
    WHERE question = "How many sales were there per product last month?";
    ```

    The agent will format its response to match the defined columns.

    This enables:

    * Programmatic consumption
    * Dashboard integration
    * Downstream automation workflows

## Usage Example

Agents enable conversation with data, including structured and unstructured data connected to MindsDB.

Connect your data to MindsDB by [connecting databases or applications](/integrations/data-overview) or [uploading files](/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/file). Users can opt for using [knowledge bases](/mindsdb_sql/knowledge_bases/overview) to store and retrieve data efficiently.

Create an agent, passing the connected data and defining the underlying model.

```sql
CREATE AGENT my_agent
USING
    model = {
        "provider": "openai",
        "model_name" : "gpt-4o",
        "api_key": "sk-abc123"
    },
    data = {
         "knowledge_bases": ["mindsdb.sales_kb", "mindsdb.orders_kb"],
         "tables": ["postgres_conn.customers", "mysql_conn.products"]
    },
    prompt_template='
        mindsdb.sales_kb stores sales analytics data
        mindsdb.orders_kb stores order data
        postgres_conn.customers stores customers data
        mysql_conn.products stores products data
    ';
```

Query an agent and ask question over the connected data.

```sql
SELECT answer
FROM my_agent 
WHERE question = 'What is the average number of orders per customers?';

-- or

SELECT customer_name, avg_number_of_orders
FROM my_agent 
WHERE question = 'What is the average number of orders per customers?';
```

## MindsDB Agents vs Minds: Feature Comparison

Both MindsDB Agents (open-source) and Minds (enterprise) are designed to answer questions over data connected to MindsDB.

The key difference lies in scope, scale, and advanced functionality:

MindsDB Agents enable querying over connected data sources that is good for:

* Prototyping
* Small-to-medium complexity use cases
* Controlled data environments

As complexity grows, Minds offers a seamless enterprise-grade upgrade path with expanded capabilities, memory, and performance.

Consider upgrading to Minds if:

* You require full data catalog visibility
* You need persistent conversation memory
* You are connecting many tables or knowledge bases
* Your workflows involve complex multi-step reasoning
* You require production-level governance and control

Minds extends the same fundamental concept as MindsDB Agents, but is designed for enterprise-scale intelligence workflows.
