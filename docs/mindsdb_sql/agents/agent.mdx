With MindsDB, you can create and deploy AI agents that comprise AI models and customizable skills such as [knowledge bases](/mindsdb_sql/knowledge-bases) and text-to-SQL.

AI agents use a conversational model (like OpenAI) from LangChain utilizing [tools as skills](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/tools/) to respond to user input. Users can customize AI agents with their own prompts to fit their use cases.

A [chatbot](/agents/chatbot) can be thought of as an agent connected to a messaging interface, such as Slack.

## `CREATE AGENT` Syntax

Here is the syntax for creating agents.

```sql
CREATE AGENT my_agent
USING 
    skills = ['text_to_sql_skill'],
    provider = 'openai',
    model = 'gpt-4',
    prompt_template = 'Answer the user input in a helpful way using tools',
    verbose = True,
    max_tokens = 100;
```

<Note>
Users can define a default model in the [MindsDB configuration under `default_llm`](/setup/custom-config) to be used with agents.
</Note>

### `skills`

Skills are essentially data connected to an agent, over which users can ask questions and get responses.

Agents can have one or more skills of different types.

There are two types of skills:

1. The `text2sql` skills translate users' questions into SQL to fetch relevant data and answer the question.

    ```sql
    CREATE SKILL text_to_sql_skill
    USING
        type = 'text2sql',
        database = 'example_db',
        tables = ['sales_data'],
        description = "this is sales data";
    ```

    The `type` parameter is set to `text2sql`.

    The `database` parameter requires the name of the data source connected to MindsDB with the [`CREATE DATABASE` command](/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/database).

    The `tables` parameter requires table names to be connected to an agent from this data source.

    The `description` parameter stores the description of data. The more explicit and verbose description helps agent to identify skills required to answer questions.

2. The `knowledge_base` skills store data in the form of embeddings and use similarity search to extract accurate data.

    ```sql
    CREATE SKILL kb_skill
    USING
        type = 'knowledge_base',
        source = 'my_knowledge_base',
        description = 'My data';
    ```

    Learn more about how to create and use [knowledge bases here](/mindsdb_sql/knowledge-bases).

For both types of skills, users can update skills.

```sql
UPDATE SKILL my_skill
SET
    <parameter> = <value>;
```

Query skills.

```sql
SHOW SKILLS;
```

And drop skills.

```sql
DROP SKILL my_skill;
```

### `provider`

Agents can be assigned different models available from [LangChain integration](/integrations/ai-engines/langchain).

The supported providers include `openai`, `anthropic`, `anyscale`, `ollama`, `litellm`, and `mindsdb`.

### `model`

The `model` parameter stores the model name as defined by the selected provider.

Alternatively, users can define models create within MindsDB with the `CREATE MODEL` command. In this case, other parameters, except for `skills`, are not required.

```sql
CREATE AGENT my_agent
USING
    model = 'my_model',
    skills = ['my_skill'];
```

### `prompt_template`

The `prompt_template` parameter is used to provide additional instructions to the agent.

Alternatively, this instruction can be provided when creating a model within MindsDB with the `CREATE MODEL` command by assigning this model to an agent.

### `verbose`

The `verbose` parameter accepts two values: `True` to generate a more detailed and expansive response, or `False` to generate a shorter, more concise response.

### `max_tokens`

The `max_tokens` parameter specifies the maximum number of tokens to be used by the model. This may affect the output by shortening the response if too less tokens are defined.

## `UPDATE AGENT` Syntax

Here is the syntax for updating an existing agent.

```sql
UPDATE AGENT my_agent
SET
    <parameter> = <value>;
```

Here `<parameter>` can be replaced by any parameter from the `CREATE AGENT` command.

For example:

```sql
UPDATE AGENT my_agent
SET
    provider = 'openai',
    model = 'gpt-4o',
    prompt_template = 'Answer the user input in a helpful way using tools and provide references';
```

Users can add and remove skills with this syntax.

```sql
UPDATE AGENT text_to_sql_agent
SET
    skills_to_add = ['new_skill'],
    skills_to_remove = ['old_skill'];
```

## `SELECT FROM AGENT` Syntax

Users can query agents with the `SELECT` statement to get answers.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM my_agent
WHERE question = "how do the sales of past week compare to last year at this time?";
```

## `DROP AGENT` Syntax

Here is the syntax for deleting agents.

```sql
DROP AGENT my_agent;
```

## Examples

### Agents with Text-to-SQL Skills

Start by creating a conversational large language model to be used by an agent.

```sql
CREATE MODEL my_model
PREDICT answer
USING
    engine = 'langchain',
    openai_api_key = 'your-model-api-key',
    model_name='gpt-4',
    mode = 'conversational',
    user_column = 'question' ,
    assistant_column = 'answer',
    max_tokens=100,
    temperature=0,
    verbose=True,
    prompt_template='Answer the user input in a helpful way';
```

<Tip>
Agents access models via the [LangChain integration with MindsDB](/integrations/ai-engines/langchain). Check out the link to find out available models.
</Tip>

Then, connect a data source to be used for creating a skill.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE example_db
WITH ENGINE = "postgres",
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "demo_user",
    "password": "demo_password",
    "host": "samples.mindsdb.com",
    "port": "5432",
    "database": "demo"
    };
 
SELECT * FROM example_db.sales_data;
```

Create a skill using one or more tables from a connected data source.

```sql
CREATE SKILL text_to_sql_skill
USING
    type = 'text2sql',
    database = 'example_db',
    tables = ['car_sales'],
    description = "this is car sales data";
```

Now that we have a model and a skill, let's create an agent.

```sql
CREATE AGENT text_to_sql_agent
USING
    model = 'my_model',
    skills = ['text_to_sql_skill'];
```

Query the agent as below:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM text_to_sql_agent
WHERE question = "how many cars were sold in 2017?"; -- this column is defined in the user_column parameter in CREATE MODEL
```

The next step would be to connect a chat app, like Slack, to MindsDB and create a chatbot utilizing this agent.

### Agents with Knowledge Bases as Skills

Create a knowledge base with the [`CREATE KNOWLEDGE_BASE` command](/mindsdb_sql/knowledge-bases).

Use this knowledge base to create a skill for an agent:

```sql
CREATE SKILL kb_skill
USING
    type = 'knowledge_base',
    source = 'my_knowledge_base',  -- this must be created with CREATE KNOWLEDGE BASE
    description = 'My data';       -- data description to help the agent know when to use the knowledge base
```

Now you can create an agent:

```sql
CREATE AGENT my_agent
USING 
    skills = ['kb_skill'],
    provider = 'openai',
    model = 'gpt-4',
    prompt_template = 'Answer the user input in a helpful way using tools',
    verbose = True,
    max_tokens = 100;
```

And query it:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM my_agent
WHERE question = "what is your data?";
```
