With MindsDB, you can create and deploy AI agents that comprise AI models and customizable skills such as knowledge bases and text-to-SQL.

AI agents use a conversational model (like OpenAI) from LangChain utilizing [tools as skills](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/tools/) to respond to user input. Users can customize AI agents with their own prompts to fit their use cases.

A [chatbot](/agents/chatbot) can be thought of as an agent connected to some messaging interface.

## How to work with AI agents

### Create skills

Start by setting up the skills. Here is how you can create and manage skills using SQL API.

* Creating, inserting into, updating, and deleting a knowledge base:

    ```sql
    CREATE KNOWLEDGE BASE my_knowledge_base
    USING
        model = embedding_model_name,              -- this parameter is optional; if not provided, a suitable embedding model is chosen for the task
        storage = vector_database.storage_table;   -- this parameter is optional; if not provided, the default ChromaDB is used for storage

    -- inserts new data rows and generates id for each row if id is not provided
    INSERT INTO my_knowledge_base
        SELECT text AS content FROM datasource.data_table;

    -- inserts new data rows and updates existing ones if id value matches
    INSERT INTO my_knowledge_base
        SELECT id, text AS content FROM datasource.data_table;

    -- view content of a knowledge base (for example, to look up the generated id values)
    SELECT * FROM my_knowledge_base;

    DROP KNOWLEDGE BASE my_knowledge_base;
    ```

* Creating, updating, and deleting a `knowledge_base` skill:

    ```sql
    CREATE SKILL kb_skill
    USING
        type = 'knowledge_base',
        source = 'my_knowledge_base', -- this must be created with CREATE KNOWLEDGE BASE
        description = 'My data'; -- data description to help the agent know when to use the knowledge base

    UPDATE SKILL kb_skill
    SET
       source = 'new_knowledge_base'; -- this must be created with CREATE KNOWLEDGE BASE

    DROP SKILL kb_skill;
    ```

* Creating, updating, and deleting a `text2sql` skill:

    ```sql
    CREATE SKILL text_to_sql_skill
    USING
        type = 'text2sql',
        database = 'example_db', -- this must be created with CREATE DATABASE
        tables = ['sales_data'], -- this is a list of tables passed to this skill
        description = "this is sales data";

    UPDATE SKILL text_to_sql_skill
    SET
        database = 'new_example_db', -- this must be created with CREATE DATABASE
        tables = ['sales_data'];     -- this is a list of tables passed to this skill

    DROP SKILL text_to_sql_skill;
    ```

You can query all skills using this command:

```sql
SHOW KNOWLEDGE_BASES;

SHOW SKILLS;
```

### Create an agent

An agent can be created, deleted, queried, and updated. Here is how you can do that using SQL API.

* Creating an AI agent:

    ```sql
    CREATE AGENT my_agent
    USING
       model = 'chatbot_agent', -- this must be a conversational model created with CREATE MODEL (as in the Example section)
       skills = ['test_skill']; -- this must be created with CREATE SKILL
    ```

    Alternatively, you can create an agent and define the model to be used by an agent at the agent creation time based on [the model providers defined here](/integrations/ai-engines/langchain#openai).

    ```sql
    CREATE AGENT my_agent
    USING 
        skills=['text_to_sql_skill'], -- this must be created with CREATE SKILL
        provider='openai', -- choose one of the available model providers (openai, anthropic, anyscale, ollama, litellm, mindsdb)
        model='gpt-4', -- define the model from the provider
        prompt_template='Answer the user input in a helpful way using tools', -- provide instruction to the model
        verbose=True,
        max_tokens=100;
    ```

* Updating an AI agent:

    ```sql
    UPDATE AGENT my_agent
    SET
       model = 'new_chatbot_agent',           -- this must be a conversational model created with CREATE MODEL
       skills_to_remove = ['test_skill'],
       skills_to_add = ['production_skill'];  -- this must be created with CREATE SKILL
    ```

* Querying an AI agent:

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM my_agent
    WHERE question = "insert your question"; -- this is the user_column parameter as defined when creating a conversational model for the agent (as in the Example section)
    ```

* Deleting an AI agent:

    ```sql
    DROP AGENT my_agent;
    ```

You can query all agents using this command:

```sql
SHOW AGENTS [FROM project_name];

SELECT * FROM agents;
```

## Example

### Agents with Text-to-SQL Skills

Start by creating a conversational large language model to be used by an agent.

```sql
CREATE MODEL my_model
PREDICT answer
USING
    engine = 'langchain',
    openai_api_key = 'your-model-api-key',
    model_name='gpt-4',
    mode = 'conversational',
    user_column = 'question' ,
    assistant_column = 'answer',
    max_tokens=100,
    temperature=0,
    verbose=True,
    prompt_template='Answer the user input in a helpful way';
```

<Tip>
Agents access models via the [LangChain integration with MindsDB](/integrations/ai-engines/langchain). Check out the link to find out available models.
</Tip>

Then, connect a data source to be used for creating a skill.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE example_db
WITH ENGINE = "postgres",
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "demo_user",
    "password": "demo_password",
    "host": "samples.mindsdb.com",
    "port": "5432",
    "database": "demo"
    };
 
SELECT * FROM example_db.sales_data;
```

Create a skill using one or more tables from a connected data source.

```sql
CREATE SKILL text_to_sql_skill
USING
    type = 'text2sql',
    database = 'example_db',
    tables = ['car_sales'],
    description = "this is car sales data";
```

Now that we have a model and a skill, let's create an agent.

```sql
CREATE AGENT text_to_sql_agent
USING
    model = 'my_model',
    skills = ['text_to_sql_skill'];
```

Query the agent as below:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM text_to_sql_agent
WHERE question = "how many cars were sold in 2017?"; -- this column is defined in the user_column parameter in CREATE MODEL
```

The next step would be to connect a chat app, like Slack, to MindsDB and create a chatbot utilizing this agent.

### Agents with Knowledge Bases as Skills

In this example, let's create an embedding model (using [OpenAI](/integrations/ai-engines/openai) or [LangChain](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/tree/main/mindsdb/integrations/handlers/langchain_embedding_handler) as an engine) for the knowledge base. Note that this step is optional, as knowledge bases provide default embedding model.

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE openai_engine
FROM openai
USING
   openai_api_key = 'your-openai-api-key';

CREATE MODEL embedding_model
PREDICT embeddings
USING
   engine = 'openai_engine',
   mode='embedding',
   model_name='text-embedding-ada-002',
   question_column = 'content';
```

Now let's create a knowledge base that uses this embedding model and the default storage vector database (that is, ChromaDB).

```sql
CREATE KNOWLEDGE BASE my_knowledge_base
USING
   model = embedding_model; -- this is optional
```

This is how you can insert data into the knowledge base and select it.

```sql
INSERT INTO my_knowledge_base (content)
VALUES ('I drink tea.');

SELECT * FROM my_knowledge_base;
```

Use this knowledge base to create a skill for an agent:

```sql
CREATE SKILL kb_skill
USING
    type = 'knowledge_base',
    source = 'my_knowledge_base',  -- this must be created with CREATE KNOWLEDGE BASE
    description = 'My data';       -- data description to help the agent know when to use the knowledge base
```

Now you can assign this skill to the agent ( that was created in the example above) and query it again:

```sql
UPDATE AGENT text_to_sql_agent
SET
    skills_to_add = ['kb_skill'];

SELECT *
FROM text_to_sql_agent
WHERE questions = "what is your data?";
```
