Within MindsDB, chatbots are [agents](/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent) connected to a chat interface.

Creating a chatbot requires either an [AI agent](/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent) or an LLM, and a connection to a chat app, like [Slack](/integrations/app-integrations/slack) or [MS Teams](/integrations/app-integrations/microsoft-teams).

## Chatbot with an AI agent

[AI Agents](/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent) are customized AI models that can answer questions over your data. You can connect your data to agents in the form of [skills](/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent#create-skills).

Here is how to create a chatbot that integrates an AI Agent and can be connected to a chat interface to have a conversation with your data.

```sql
CREATE CHATBOT my_chatbot
USING
    database = 'my_slack',   -- created with CREATE DATABASE my_slack
    agent = 'my_agent',   -- created with CREATE AGENT my_agent
    is_running = true;   -- default is true
```

The parameters include the following:

* `database` stores connection to a chat app (like [Slack](/integrations/app-integrations/slack) or [MS Teams](/integrations/app-integrations/microsoft-teams)) that should be created with the `CREATE DATABASE` statement.
* `agent` is an [AI agent](/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent) created with the `CREATE AGENT` command. It consists of an AI model and a set of skills, that is, defined data sets provided at inference time via RAG-based techniques.
* `is_running` indicates whether or not to start the chatbot upon creation.

<Tip>
Here are some tips for using the Slack integration:

1. If you want to use Slack in the [`CREATE CHATBOT`](/agents/chatbot) syntax, use [this method of connecting Slack to MindsDB](/integrations/app-integrations/slack#method-1-chatbot-responds-in-direct-messages-to-a-slack-app).

2. If you want to connect the chatbot to multiple Slack channels, open your Slack application and add the App/Bot to one or more channels:
  - Go to the channel where you want to use the bot.
  - Right-click on the channel and select *View Channel Details*.
  - Select *Integrations*.
  - Click on *Add an App*.

## Chatbot with an LLM

ALternatively, you can create a chatbot that is equivalent to embedding an LLM of your choice into a chat app, like [Slack](/integrations/app-integrations/slack) or [MS Teams](/integrations/app-integrations/microsoft-teams).

Here is how to create a chatbot that integrates an LLM and can be connected to a chat interface.

```sql
CREATE CHATBOT my_chatbot
USING
    database = 'my_slack',   -- created with CREATE DATABASE my_slack
    model = 'my_model',   -- created with CREATE MODEL my_model
    is_running = true;   -- default is true
```

The parameters include the following:

* `database` stores connection to a chat app (like [Slack](/integrations/app-integrations/slack) or [MS Teams](/integrations/app-integrations/microsoft-teams)) that should be created with the `CREATE DATABASE` statement.
* `model` is a conversational model created with the `CREATE MODEL` command using the [LangChain engine](/integrations/ai-engines/langchain).
* `is_running` indicates whether or not to start the chatbot upon creation.

Here is how to delete a chatbot:

    ```sql
    DROP CHATBOT my_chatbot;
    ```

And here is how to query all chatbots:

```sql
SHOW CHATBOTS;

SELECT * FROM chatbots;
```

## Example

Following the example from [here](/agents/agent#example), let's create a chatbot utilizing the already created agent.

Start by connecting a chat app to MindsDB:

* Follow [this instruction](/integrations/app-integrations/slack) to connect Slack to MindsDB.
* Follow [this instruction](/integrations/app-integrations/microsoft-teams) to connect MS Teams to MindsDB.

Next, create a chatbot.

```sql
CREATE CHATBOT text_to_sql_chatbot
USING
    database = 'my_slack',        -- this must be created with CREATE DATABASE
    agent = 'text_to_sql_agent',  -- this must be created with CREATE AGENT
    is_running = true;
```
