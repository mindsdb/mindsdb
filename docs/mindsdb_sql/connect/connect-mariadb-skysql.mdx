## 1. Select your service for MindsDB

If you haven't already, identify the service to be enabled with MindsDB and make
sure it is running. Otherwise, skip to step 2.

## 2. Add MindsDB to your service Allowlist

Access to MariaDB SkySQL services is [restricted on a per-service basis](https://mariadb.com/products/skysql/docs/security/firewalls/ip-allowlist-services/). Add the following IP addresses to allow MindsDB to connect to your MariaDB service, do this by clicking on the cog icon and navigating to Security Access. In the dialog, input as prompted – one by one – the following IPs:

```
18.220.205.95
3.19.152.46
52.14.91.162
```

## 3. Download your service .pem file

A [certificate authority chain](https://mariadb.com/products/skysql/docs/connect/connection-parameters-portal/#certificate-authority-chain) (.pem file) must be provided for proper TLS certificate validation.

From your selected service, click on the world globe icon (Connect to service). In the Login Credentials section, click Download. The `aws_skysql_chain.pem`
file will download onto your machine.

## 4. Publically Expose your service .pem File

Select secure storage for the `aws_skysql_chain.pem` file that allows a working public URL or localpath. For example, you can store it in an S3 bucket.

## 5. Link MindsDB to your MariaDB SkySQL Service

To print the query template, go to MindsDB Editor and add a new data source from the Connect tab, choose MariaDB SkySQL from the list. Fill in the values and run a query to complete the setup.

Here are the codes:

    ```sql Template
    CREATE DATABASE maria_datasource            --- display name for the database
    WITH ENGINE = 'MariaDB',                      --- name of the MindsDB handler
    PARAMETERS = {
      "host": " ",                              --- host IP address or URL

      "ssl": True/False,                        --- optional, the `ssl` parameter value indicates whether SSL is enabled (`True`) or disabled (`False`)

        "path": " "                                 --- either "path" or "url"
      },
      "ssl_cert": {                             --- optional, SSL certificates
        "url": " "                                  --- either "path" or "url"
      },
      "ssl_key": {                              --- optional, SSL keys
        "path": " "                                 --- either "path" or "url"
      }
    };
    ```

    ```sql Example for MariaDB SkySQL Service
    CREATE DATABASE skysql_datasource

    PARAMETERS = {
