DBeaver is a database tool that allows you to connect to and work with
various database engines. You can download it [here](https://dbeaver.io/).

## Data Setup

First, create a new database connection in DBeaver by clicking the icon, as
shown below.

Next, choose the MySQL database engine and click the _Next_ button.

<Warning>
If you have multiple `MySQL` options, choose the `Driver for MySQL8 and later`.

Now it's time to fill in the connection details.

</p>

There are three options, as below.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Local MindsDB">
    You can connect to your local MindsDB. To do that, please use the connection details below:
    
    ```
    Hostname: `127.0.0.1`
    Port: `47334`
    Username: `mindsdb`
    Password: <leave it empty>
    Database: <leave it empty>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Now we are ready to test the connection.

## Testing the Connection

Click on the `Test Connection...` button to check if all the provided data
allows you to connect to MindsDB.

On success, you should see the message, as below.

## Let's Run Some Queries

To finally make sure that our MindsDB database connection works, let's run some
queries.

```sql
SHOW FULL DATABASES;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+----------------------+---------+--------+
| Database             | TYPE    | ENGINE |
+----------------------+---------+--------+
| information_schema   | system  | [NULL] |
| mindsdb              | project | [NULL] |
| files                | data    | files  |
+----------------------+---------+--------+
```

Here is how it looks in DBeaver:
