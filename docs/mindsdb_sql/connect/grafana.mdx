[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is an open-source analytics and interactive visualization web application
that allows users to ingest data from various sources, query this data, and display it on customizable charts for easy analysis. 

## How to Connect

To begin, set up Grafana by following one of the methods outlined in the [Grafana Installation Documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/#supported-operating-systems).

Once Grafana is successfully set up in your environment, navigate to the Connections section, click on Add new connection, and select the MySQL plugin
, as shown below.

    Username: `mindsdb`
    Password: <leave it empty>

you can query data in the Explore view. Use the text edit mode to compose your queries.

```sql
SHOW FULL DATABASES;
```

On execution, we get:

### Visual Query Builder

Now you can build a dashboard with a MindsDB database connection.
Example query :

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mysql_demo_db
WITH ENGINE = "mysql",
PARAMETERS = {
   "user": "user",
   "password": "MindsDBUser123!",
   "host": "samples.mindsdb.com",
   "port": "3306",
   "database": "public"
   };

SELECT * FROM mysql_demo_db.air_passengers;
```

On execution, we get:
