Custom functions provide advanced means of manipulating data. Users can upload custom functions written in Python to MindsDB and apply them to data.

## How It Works

You can upload your custom functions via the MindsDB editor by clicking `Add` and `Upload custom functions`, like this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/upload_custom_function.png" />
</p>

Here is the form that needs to be filled out in order to bring your custom functions to MindsDB:

</p>

Let's briefly go over the files that need to be uploaded:

* The Python file stores an implementation of your custom functions. Here is the sample format:

    ```py
    def function_name_1(self, a, b):
        <implementation goes here>
        return x

    def function_name_2(self, a, b, c):
        <implementation goes here>
        return x
    ```

<Accordion title="Example">
    ```py
    def add_integers(self, a:int, b:int) -> int:
        return a+b

    def add_variables(self, a, b):
        return a+b
    ```
</Accordion>

* The requirements file, or `requirements.txt`, stores all dependencies along with their versions. Here is the sample format:

    ```sql
    dependency_package_1 == version
    dependency_package_2 >= version
    dependency_package_3 >= verion, < version
    ...
    ```

<Accordion title="Example">
    ```sql
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    ```
</Accordion>

Once you upload the above files, please provide the name for a storage collection.

Let's look at an example.

## Example

We upload the custom functions, as below:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/upload_custom_function2.png" />
</p>

Here we upload the `custom_functions.py` file that stores an implementation of the functions and the `requirements.txt` file that stores all the dependencies. We named the storage collection as `functions`.

Now we can use the functions as below:

```sql
SELECT functions.add_integers(sqft, 1) AS added_one, sqft
FROM example_db.home_rentals
LIMIT 1;
```

Here is the output:

```sql
+-----------+------+
| added_one | sqft |
+-----------+------+
| 918       | 917  |
+-----------+------+
```

And:

```sql
SELECT functions.add_variables(sqft, 1) AS added_one, sqft
FROM example_db.home_rentals
LIMIT 1;
```

Here is the output:

```sql
+-----------+------+
| added_one | sqft |
+-----------+------+
| 9171      | 917  |
+-----------+------+
```
