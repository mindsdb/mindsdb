MindsDB provides the `LLM()` function that lets users incorporate the LLM-generated output directly into the data queries.

## Prerequisites

The `LLM()` function uses one of the OpenAI models and requires the OpenAI API key.

To use the `LLM()` function with MindsDB, define the model to be used and the OpenAI API key as environment variables.

* The `LLM_FUNCTION_MODEL` environment variable should store the OpenAI model name, like `gpt-4`.
* The `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable should store the OpenAI API key value.

## Usage

You can use the `LLM()` function to simply ask a question and get an answer.

```sql
SELECT LLM('How many planets are there in the solar system?');
```

Here is the output:

```sql
+------------------------------------------+
| llm                                      |
+------------------------------------------+
| There are 8 planets in the solar system. |
+------------------------------------------+
```

Moreover, you can the `LLM()` function with your data to swiftly complete tasks such as text generation or summarization.

```sql
SELECT
    comment,
    LLM('Describe the comment''s category in one word: ' || comment) AS category
FROM example_db.user_comments;
```

Here is the output:

```sql
+--------------------------+----------+
| comment                  | category |
+--------------------------+----------+
| I hate tacos             | Dislike  |
| I want to dance          | Desire   |
| Baking is not a big deal | Opinion  |
+--------------------------+----------+
```
