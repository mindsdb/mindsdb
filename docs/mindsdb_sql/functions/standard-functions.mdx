### Aggregate Functions

MindsDB supports aggregate functions via DuckDB. See the [complete list here](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/sql/functions/aggregates).

SQL aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single result, making them useful for summarizing or analyzing data across multiple rows. Common aggregate functions include `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`. These functions are used with `GROUP BY` to organize results by specific categories.

```sql
SELECT
        year,
        SUM(salary) AS annual_salary
FROM salaries
GROUP BY year;
```

### Array Functions





### Window Functions

todo

Window functions in SQL perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row, without collapsing rows into a single result like aggregate functions do. These functions are useful for ranking, calculating running totals, and working with moving averages. Common window functions include `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `NTILE(n)`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `SUM()`, and `AVG()`.

```sql
SELECT
        a + b * (c-d) as a,
        AVG(a) OVER (PARTITION BY b)
FROM table_name;
```
