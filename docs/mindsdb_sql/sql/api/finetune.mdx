## Description

The `FINETUNE` statement lets you retrain a model with additional training data.

Imagine you have a model that was trained with a certain dataset. Now there is more training data available and you wish to retrain this model with a new dataset. The `FINETUNE` statement lets you partially retrain the model, so it takes less time and resources than the [`RETRAIN`](/sql/api/retrain) statement. In the machine learning literature, this is also referred to as *fine-tuning* a model.

## Syntax

Here is the syntax:

```sql
FINETUNE [MODEL] project_name.model_name
FROM integration_name
    (SELECT column_name, ... FROM table_name)
[USING
    key = value,
    ...];
```

Where:

| Expressions                                 | Description                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `project_name`                              | Name of the project where the model resides.                                                                       |
| `model_name`                                | Name of the model to be retrained.                                                                                 |
| `integration_name`                          | Name of the integration created using the [`CREATE DATABASE`](/sql/create/databases) statement or file upload.    |
| `(SELECT column_name, ... FROM table_name)` | Selecting additional data to be used for retraining.                                                               |
| `USING key = value`                         | Optional. The `USING` clause lets you pass multiple parameters to the `FINETUNE` statement.                          |

<Info>
**Model Versions**

Every time the model is retrained/adjusted, its new version is created with an incremented version number. Unless overridden, the most recent version becomes active when training completes.

You can query for all model versions like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM project_name.models_versions;
```

For more information on managing model versions, check out our docs [here](/sql/api/manage-models-versions).
