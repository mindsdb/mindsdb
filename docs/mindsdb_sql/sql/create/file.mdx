### Configuring URL File Upload for Specific Domains

The File Uploader can be configured to interact only with specific domains by using the `file_upload_domains` setting in the `config.json` file. 
This feature allows you to restrict the handler to upoad and process files only from the domains you specify, enhancing security and control over web interactions.

To configure this, simply list the allowed domains under the `file_upload_domains` key in `config.json`. For example:

```json
"file_upload_domains": [
   "s3.amazonaws.com",
    "drive.google.com"
]
```
