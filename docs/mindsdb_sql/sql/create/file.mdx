### Configuring URL File Upload for Specific Domains

The File Uploader can be configured to control file uploads via URLs using the `url_file_upload` settings in the `config.json` file.
This feature allows you to enable/disable URL file uploads entirely and specify allowed or disallowed origins, enhancing security and control over web interactions.

To configure this, simply change the `url_file_upload` settings in `config.json` with `enabled`, `allowed_origins`, and `disallowed_origins` parameters. For example:
```json
{
   "url_file_upload": {
      "enabled": true,
      "allowed_origins": ["https://example.com"],
      "disallowed_origins": ["http://example.com"]
    }
}
```
