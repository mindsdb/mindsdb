Follow the steps below to upload a file to MindsDB.

<Note>
Note that the trailing whitespaces on column names are erased upon uploading a file to MindsDB.

1. Access the MindsDB Editor.
2. Open the `Add` menu and choose `Upload file`.

   </p>

3. Select a file, provide its name, and click on `Save & Continue`.

   <p align="center">
     <img src="/assets/sql/upload_file2.png" />
   </p>

4. Now you can query the file.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM files.file_name;
   ```

Here is how to list all files:

```sql
SHOW TABLES FROM files;
```

This command is the same as the command for listing tables because files uploaded to MindsDB become tables within the MindsDB ecosystem and are stored in the `files` database.

### Configuring URL File Upload for Specific Domains

The File Uploader can be configured to interact only with specific domains by using the [`url_file_upload` key in `config.json` file](/setup/custom-config#url-file-upload). 
This feature allows you to restrict the handler to upoad and process files only from the domains you specify, enhancing security and control over web interactions.

To configure this, simply list the allowed domains under the [`url_file_upload` key in `config.json` file](/setup/custom-config#url-file-upload).
