MindsDB supports standard SQL syntax, including the SQL aggregate functions.

SQL aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single result, making them useful for summarizing or analyzing data across multiple rows. Common aggregate functions include `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`. These functions are used with `GROUP BY` to organize results by specific categories.

```sql
SELECT
        year,
        SUM(salary) AS annual_salary
FROM salaries
GROUP BY year;
```
