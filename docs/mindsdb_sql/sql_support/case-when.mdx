MindsDB supports standard SQL syntax, including the `CASE WHEN` statement.

The `CASE WHEN` statement is used for conditional logic within queries. It evaluates conditions and returns specific values based on whether each condition is true or false, allowing for conditional output within `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and other clauses.

```sql
SELECT
        CASE
            WHEN a=1 THEN a+b
            WHEN 1+2=b*2 THEN 0
            WHEN (a+b>2 or b<c+3) AND a>b THEN b
            ELSE c
        END
FROM table_name;
```
