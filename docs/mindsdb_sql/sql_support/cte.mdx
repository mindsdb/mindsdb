MindsDB supports standard SQL syntax, including Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

CTEs are used to create temporary, named result sets that simplify complex queries, enhance readability, and allow for modular query design by breaking down large queries into manageable parts.

```sql
WITH table_name1 AS (
    
    SELECT columns
    FROM table1 t1
    JOIN table2 t2
    ON t1.col = t2.col
),

table_name2 AS (
    
    SELECT columns
    FROM table1 t1
    JOIN table2 t2
    ON t1.col = t2.col
)

SELECT columns
FROM table_name1 t1
JOIN table_name2 t2
ON t1.col - t2.col;
```
