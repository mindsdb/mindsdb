MindsDB supports standard SQL syntax, including the SQL window functions.

Window functions in SQL perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row, without collapsing rows into a single result like aggregate functions do. These functions are useful for ranking, calculating running totals, and working with moving averages. Common window functions include `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `NTILE(n)`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `SUM()`, and `AVG()`.

```sql
SELECT
        a + b * (c-d) as a,
        AVG(a) OVER (PARTITION BY b)
FROM table_name;
```
