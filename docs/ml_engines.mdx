MindsDB offers a wide range of AI engines used to create models and incorporate them in the data landscape as virtual tables. MinsdDB abstracts AI models as virtual tables, or Generative AI Tables, that can generate data from the underlying model upon being queried.

You can create an ML engine with the `CREATE ML_ENGINE` statement.
