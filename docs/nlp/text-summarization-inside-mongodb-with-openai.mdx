## Introduction

In this blog post, we present how to create OpenAI models within MindsDB. In this example, we ask a model to provide a summary of a text. The input data is taken from our sample MongoDB database.

## Prerequisites

To follow along, you can sign up for an account at [cloud.mindsdb.com](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/register/nlp). Alternatively, head to [MindsDB documentation](https://docs.mindsdb.com/) and follow the instructions to manually set up a local instance of MindsDB via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [pip](/setup/self-hosted/pip/source).

## How to Connect MindsDB to a Database

We use a collection from our MongoDB public demo database, so let’s start by connecting MindsDB to it.

You can use [Mongo Compass](/connect/mongo-compass) or [Mongo Shell](/connect/mongo-shell) to connect our sample database like this:

```bash
test> use mindsdb
mindsdb> db.databases.insertOne({
            'name': 'mongo_demo_db',
            'engine': 'mongodb',
            'connection_args': {
                "host": "mongodb+srv://user:MindsDBUser123!@demo-data-mdb.trzfwvb.mongodb.net/",
                "database": "public"
            }
        })
```

## Tutorial

In this tutorial, we create a predictive model to summarize an article.

Now that we've connected our database to MindsDB, let’s query the data to be used in the example:

```bash
mindsdb> use mongo_demo_db
mongo_demo_db> db.articles.find({}).limit(3)
```

Here is the output:

```bash
{
  _id: '63d01398bbca62e9c7774ab8',
  article: "Video footage has emerged of a law enforcement officer…",
  highlights: 'The 53-second video features…"
}
{
  _id: '63d01398bbca62e9c7774ab9',
  article: "A new restaurant is offering a five-course…",
  highlights: "The Curious Canine Kitchen is…"
}
{
  _id: '63d01398bbca62e9c7774aba',
  article: 'Mother-of-two Anna Tilley survived after spending four days…',
  highlights: 'Experts have warned hospitals not using standard treatment…'
}
```

Let's create a model collection to summarize all articles from the input dataset:

```bash
mongo_demo_db> use mindsdb
mindsdb> db.models.insertOne({
            name: 'text_summarization',
            predict: 'highlights',
            training_options: {
                        engine: 'openai',
                        prompt_template: 'provide an informative summary of the text text:{{article}} using full sentences'
                }
        })
```

<Info>
**Default Model**

When you create an OpenAI model in MindsDB, it uses the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model by default. But you can use the `gpt-4` model as well by passing it to the `model-name` parameter in the `training_options` clause.
</Info>

In practice, the `insertOne` method triggers MindsDB to generate an AI collection called `text_summarization` that uses the OpenAI integration to predict a field named `highlights`. The model is created inside the default `mindsdb` project. In MindsDB, projects are a natural way to keep artifacts, such as models or views, separate according to what predictive task they solve. You can learn more about MindsDB projects [here](/sql/project).

The `training_options` key specifies the parameters that this handler requires.

- The `engine` parameter defines that we use the `openai` engine.
- The `prompt_template` parameter conveys the structure of a message that is to be completed with additional text generated by the model.

<Warning title = "Using OpenAI Locally or On-Premises" icon = "triangle-exclamation" color="#fcd34dcc" >

We use the OpenAI engine to create a model in MindsDB. Please note that the `api_key` parameter is optional on [cloud.mindsdb.com](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/register/nlp) but mandatory for local usage/on-premise. You can obtain an OpenAI API key by signing up for OpenAI's API services on their website. Once you have signed up, you can find your API key in the *API Key* section of the OpenAI dashboard. You can then pass this API key to the MindsDB platform when creating models.

To create a `text_summarization` model in MindsDB, you can run the following code:

```bash
mindsdb> db.models.insertOne({
            name: 'text_summarization',
            predict: 'highlights',
            training_options: {
                        engine: 'openai',
                        prompt_template: 'provide an informative summary of the text text:{{article}} using full sentences',
			                  api_key: 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'  -- MANDATORY FOR LOCAL MODE
                }
        })
```

Alternatively, you can create a MindsDB ML engine that includes the API key, so you don't have to enter it each time. Please note that this command should be executed from MindsDB.

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE openai2
FROM openai
USING
  api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY';
```
Please note that it is required to provide an OpenAI API key when using MindsDB Pro version.

</Warning>

<Note>
If you want to use the OpenAI API key provided by MindsDB, please confirm your email. Alternatively, you have the option to utilize your own OpenAI API key by specifying it in the `api_key` parameter.
</Note>

Once the `insertOne` method has started execution, we can check the status of the creation process with the following query:

```bash
mindsdb> db.getCollection('models').find({
            'name': 'text_summarization'
        })
```

It may take a while to register as complete depending on the internet connection. Once the creation is complete, the behavior is the same as with any other AI collection – you can query it either by specifying synthetic data in the actual query:

```bash
mindsdb> db.text_summarization.find({
            article: "Apple's Watch hits stores this Friday when customers and employees alike will be able to pre-order the timepiece. And boss Tim Cook is rewarding his staff by offering them a 50 per cent discount on the device."
        })
```

Here is the output data:

```bash
{
  highlights: "Apple's Watch hits stores this Friday, and employees will be able to pre-order the",
  article: "Apple's Watch hits stores this Friday when customers and employees alike will be able to pre-order the timepiece. And boss Tim Cook is rewarding his staff by offering them a 50 per cent discount on the device."
}
```

Or by joining with a collection for batch predictions:

```bash
mindsdb> db.text_summarization.find(
            {
                'collection': 'mongo_demo_db.articles'
            },
            {
                'text_summarization.highlights': 'highlights',
                'articles.article': 'article'
            }
        ).limit(3)
```

Here is the output data:

```bash
{
  highlights: 'A video has emerged of a law enforcement officer grabbing a cell phone from a woman who was',
  article: "Video footage has emerged of a law enforcement officer..."
}
{
  highlights: 'A new restaurant in London is offering a five-course drink-paired menu for dogs',
  article: "A new restaurant is offering a five-course..."
}
{
  highlights: "Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an",
  article: 'Mother-of-two Anna Tilley survived after spending four days...'
}
```

The `articles` collection is used to make batch predictions. Upon joining the `text_summarization` model with the `articles` collection, the model uses all values from the `article` field.

## Leverage the NLP Capabilities with MindsDB

By integrating databases and OpenAI using MindsDB, developers can easily extract insights from text data with just a few SQL commands. These powerful natural language processing (NLP) models are capable of answering questions with or without context and completing general prompts.

Furthermore, these models are powered by large pre-trained language models from OpenAI, so there is no need for manual development work. Ultimately, this provides developers with an easy way to incorporate powerful NLP capabilities into their applications while saving time and resources compared to traditional ML development pipelines and methods. All in all, MindsDB makes it possible for developers to harness the power of OpenAI efficiently!

MindsDB is now the fastest-growing open-source applied machine-learning platform in the world. Its community continues to contribute to more than 70 data-source and ML-framework integrations. Stay tuned for the upcoming features - including more control over the interface parameters and fine-tuning models directly from MindsDB!
