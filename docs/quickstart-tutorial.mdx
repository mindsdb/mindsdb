Before we start, install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).

Get started with MindsDB in a few simple steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect">
    Connect one or more data sources. Explore all available [data sources here](/integrations/data-overview).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Unify">
    Unify your data with [knowledge bases](/mindsdb_sql/knowledge_bases/overview).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Respond">
    Respond to questions over your data with [AI agents](/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 1. Connect

MindsDB enables connecting data from various data sources and operating on data without moving it from its source. Learn more [here](/mindsdb-connect).

* **Connecting Structured Data**

Use the [`CREATE DATABASE`](/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/database) statement to connect a data source to MindsDB.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mysql_demo_db
WITH ENGINE = 'mysql',
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "user",
    "password": "MindsDBUser123!",
    "host": "samples.mindsdb.com",
    "port": "3306",
    "database": "public"
};
```

This is the input data used in the following steps:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mysql_demo_db.home_rentals
LIMIT 3;
```

The sample contains contains information about properties for rent.

* **Connecting Unstructured Data**

Extract data from webpages using the [web crawler](/integrations/app-integrations/web-crawler) or [upload files](/integrations/files/csv-xlsx-xls) to MindsDB.

In this example, we fetch data from MindsDB Documentation webpage using the web crawler.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_web 
WITH ENGINE = 'web';

SELECT url, text_content
FROM my_web.crawler
WHERE url = 'https://docs.mindsdb.com/'
```

Now we save this data into a view which is saved in the default `mindsdb` project.

```sql
CREATE VIEW mindsdb_docs (
    SELECT url, text_content
    FROM my_web.crawler
    WHERE url = 'https://docs.mindsdb.com/'
);

SELECT *
FROM mindsdb.mindsdb_docs;
```

## Step 2. Unify

MindsDB enables unifying data from structured and unstructured data sources into a single, queryable interface. This unified view allows seamless querying and model-building across all data without consolidation into one system. Learn more [here](/mindsdb-unify).

Create a knowledge base to store all your data in a single location. Learn more about [knowledge bases here](/mindsdb_sql/knowledge_bases/overview).

```sql
CREATE KNOWLEDGE_BASE my_kb
USING
    embedding_model = {
        "provider": "openai",
        "model_name" : "text-embedding-3-large",
        "api_key": "your-openai-api-key"
    },
    reranking_model = {
        "provider": "openai",
        "model_name": "gpt-4o",
        "api_key": "your-openai-api-key"
    },
    content_columns = ['content'];
```

[Insert data](/mindsdb_sql/knowledge_bases/insert_data) from Step 1 into the knowledge base.

```sql
INSERT INTO my_kb
    SELECT
            'number_of_rooms: ' || number_of_rooms || ', ' ||
            'number_of_bathrooms' || number_of_bathrooms || ', ' ||
            'sqft' || sqft || ', ' ||
            'location' || location || ', ' ||
            'days_on_market' || days_on_market || ', ' ||
            'neighborhood' || neighborhood || ', ' ||
            'rental_price' || rental_price
                AS content
    FROM mysql_demo_db.home_rentals;

INSERT INTO my_kb
    SELECT text_content AS content
    FROM mindsdb.mindsdb_docs;
```

[Query the knowledge base](/mindsdb_sql/knowledge_bases/query) to search your data.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM my_kb
WHERE content = 'what is MindsDB';

SELECT *
FROM my_kb
WHERE content = 'rental price lower than 2000';
```

<Tip>
In order to keep the knowledge base up-to-date with your data, use [jobs](/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/jobs) to automate data inserts every time your data is modified.

```sql
CREATE JOB update_kb (

  INSERT INTO my_kb
      SELECT
              'number_of_rooms: ' || number_of_rooms || ', ' ||
              'number_of_bathrooms' || number_of_bathrooms || ', ' ||
              'sqft' || sqft || ', ' ||
              'location' || location || ', ' ||
              'days_on_market' || days_on_market || ', ' ||
              'neighborhood' || neighborhood || ', ' ||
              'rental_price' || rental_price
                  AS content
      FROM mysql_demo_db.home_rentals
      WHERE created_at > LATEST
)
EVERY 1 day;
```
</Tip>

## Step 3. Respond

MindsDB enables generating insightful and accurate responses from unified data using natural language. Learn more [here](/mindsdb-respond).

Create an [agent](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent) that can answer questions over your unified data from Step 2.

```sql
CREATE AGENT my_agent
USING
    model = {
        "provider": "openai",
        "model_name" : "gpt-4o",
        "api_key": "your-openai-api-key"
    },
    data = {
         "knowledge_bases": ["mindsdb.my_kb"],
         "tables": ["mysql_demo_db.home_rentals"]
    },
    prompt_template = 'mindsdb.my_kb stores data about mindsdb and home rentals,
                      mysql_demo_db.home_rentals stores data about home rentals';
```

Now you can ask questions over your data.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM my_agent
WHERE question = 'what is MindsDB?';
```

Visit the [Respond tab in the MindsDB Editor](/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent_gui) to chat with an agent.
