**POST `/api/projects/{project_name}/agents/{agent_name}/completions[/stream]`**

This API endpoint queries an agent using the `POST` method. The `completions` endpoints returns an answer, while the `completions/stream` endpoint streams the thoughts and returns an answer.

<Tip>
Learn more about agents and the available parameters following [this doc page](/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent).

### Path Parameters

<ParamField body='project_name' type='string' required>
Defines the project where the agents are located. Note that the default project name is `mindsdb`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body='agent_name' type='string' required>
Defines the agent name.
</ParamField>

### Body

<ParamField body='messages' type='string'>
Stores the question to an agent.
</ParamField>

### Response

<ResponseField name="data" type="string" required>  
Returns data chunks containing thoughts and an answer.
</ResponseField>
