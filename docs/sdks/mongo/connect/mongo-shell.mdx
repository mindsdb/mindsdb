MongoDB Shell is the quickest way to connect and work with MongoDB.

MindsDB provides a powerful MongoDB API, allowing users to connect MindsDB to the [MongoDB Shell](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell). Please note that connection to MongoDB API provided by MindsDB is the same as connection to a MongoDB database. You can download MongoDB Shell [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell).

Let's go through the steps presented above:

1. We connect MongoDB Shell to MindsDB. It is discussed in the following content.

2. We connect MindsDB to a database. You can use the [`CREATE DATABASE`](/sql/create/databases) statement and run it from MindsDB, passing all required database connection details.

3. Having completed steps 1 and 2, you can access the connected database from MongoDB Shell via MindsDB.

    Provide your local MindsDB connection string to connect to a local MindsDB installation. You can copy the connection string from the MongoDB Compass if you have already created a connection there.

    Here is a connection string to connect to a local MindsDB installation:

    ```bash
    mongodb://127.0.0.1:47336/
