## Description

With MindsDB, you can create and deploy AI agents that comprise AI models and customizable skills such as knowledge bases and text-to-SQL.

There are two types of skills available in MindsDB:

1. Text2SQL skill translates users' questions into SQL queries and fetches relevant information from data sources assigned to this skill.
2. Knowledge Bases store data from databases, files, or webpages, and use different retrieval methods to fetch relevant information and present it as answers.

## Syntax

To feed an agent with data from different sources, use the knowledge_base skills.

Here is how to create a knowledge base:

```python
my_kb = server.knowledge_bases.create('my_kb')
```

Here is how to insert data into a knowledge base:

* Inserting data from files:

*Note that the file should be uploaded to MindsDB before inserting it into the knowledge base.*

```python
my_kb.insert_files(["file_name_uploaded_to_mindsdb", ...])
```

* Inserting data from the web:

```python
my_kb.insert_webpages(["https://docs.mindsdb.com/"], 1):
```

Optionally, you can specify the crawl depth as the second argument. For example, the crawl depth of 1 indicates that all links present on `https://docs.mindsdb.com/` will be crawled, and the crawl depth of 2 indicates that all links present on those pages will be crawled, and so on.

* Inserting data from data sources connected to MindsDB:

```python
my_kb.insert(server.databases.db_name.tables.table_name.filter(column_name='value'))
```

* Inserting raw data:

```python
my_kb.insert({'column_name': 'value', 'column_name': 'value', ...})
```

<Tip>
When inserting data to a knowledge base, you can specify the `partition_size` parameter to split data into partitions and run prediction on different workers. Note that the [ML task queue](/setup/custom-config#overview-of-config-parameters) needs to be enabled to use this parameter.

To use the `partition_size` parameter, provide the below argument to the `insert` function, specifying the partition size, like this:

```
my_kb.insert(df, params={'model': {'partition_size': 100}})
```
</Tip>

Here is how to query data from a knowledge base using specified keywords:

```python
df = my_kb.fetch()
-- or
df = my_kb.find('keyword').fetch()
```

Here is how to list all available knowledge bases:

```python
kb_list = server.knowledge_bases.list()
```

Here is how to get a knowledge base by name:

```python
kb = server.knowledge_bases.get('my_kb')
# or
kb = server.knowledge_bases.my_kb
```

Here is how to drop a knowledge base:

```python
server.knowledge_bases.drop('my_kb')
```
