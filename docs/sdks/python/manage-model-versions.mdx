Below are the functions that let you work with multiple version of a model.

Use the `list_versions()` method to view all available version of a model:

```python
model_name.list_versions()
```

Use the `get_version()` method to use a specific version of a model:

```python
model_name.get_version(9)
```

Use the `set_active()` method to set a specific version of a model as active:

```python
model_name.set_active(9)
```

Use the `drop_model_version()` method to remove a specific version of a model:

```python
project.drop_model_version('my_model', 3)
```

Please note that the model version should be deactivated before it is removed.
