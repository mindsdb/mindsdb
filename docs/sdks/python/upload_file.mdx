## Description

In MindsDB, files are treated as tables. These are stored in the default `files` database. To upload a file, you must save this `files` database into a variable and then, run the `create_table()` function on it.

<Note>
Note that the trailing whitespaces on column names are erased upon uploading a file to MindsDB.

## Syntax

Here is the syntax:

```
files_db = server.get_database('files')
files_db.create_table('file_name', data_frame)
```
