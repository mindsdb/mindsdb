Most of the MindsDB functionality can be modified by extending the default configuration, but some of the configuration options 
can be added as environment variables on the server where MindsDB is deployed.

## MindsDB Storage 

By default, MindsDB stores the configuration files by determining appropriate platform-specific directories, e.g. a "user data dir": 

* On Linux `~/.local/share/mindsdb/var`
* On MacOS `~/Library/Application Support/mindsdb/var`
* On Windows `C:\Documents and Settings\<User>\Application Data\Local Settings\<AppAuthor>\mindsdb\var`

In the `MINDSDB_STORAGE_DIR` location, MindsDB stores users' data, models and uploaded data files, the static assets for the frontend application and the 
`sqlite.db` file. 
You can change the default storage location using `MINDSDB_STORAGE_DIR` variable.

#### Example

```
MINDSDB_STORAGE_DIR='~/home/mindsdb/var'
```


## MindsDB Configuration Storage 

MindsDB uses `sqlite` database by default to store the required configuration as models, projects, files metadata etc. 
The full list of the above schemas can be found [here](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/main/mindsdb/interfaces/storage/db.py#L69). You can change the 
default storage option and use different database by adding the new connection string using `MINDSDB_DB_CON` variable.

#### Example

```
MINDSDB_DB_CON='postgresql://user:secret@localhost'
```

## MindsDB server

By default for the HTTP API, MindsDB uses [Waitress](https://pypi.org/project/waitress/) which is a pure-Python WSGI server. There is an option to change that 
and use [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) or [Gunircorn](https://gunicorn.org/)

<Warning>

If you want to use Gunicorn as a default server, make sure you run `pip install gunicorn`

</Warning>

#### Example

```
MINDSDB_DEFAULT_SERVER=flask
```

## MindsDB Updates

If you use on-premise deployment of MindsDB and you do not use MindsDB SQL editor, you can set the `CHECK_FOR_UPDATES` environment variable as below,

### Example

```bash
CHECK_FOR_UPDATES = 0
```
