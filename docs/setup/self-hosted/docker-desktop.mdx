</Tip>

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have installed Docker Desktop, following the [official Docker Desktop documentation](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

## Setup

This setup of MindsDB uses the `mindsdb/mindsdb:latest` Docker image, which is a lightweight Docker image of MindsDB that comes with [these integrations preloaded](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/main/default_handlers.txt).

Follow the steps to set up MindsDB in Docker Desktop.

### Install the MindsDB Docker Desktop Extension

<Tip>
If you are a Windows user, ensure that you have enabled Developer Mode under settings before installing the extension.

It is not necessary to keep Developer Mode enabled to use the extension. Once the extension is installed, you can disable Developer Mode if you wish.
</Tip>

Go to the Extensions page in Docker Desktop and search for MindsDB.

Install the MindsDB extension.

<Tip>
The first time the extension is installed, it will run the latest version of MindsDB. Moving forward, it's advisable to regularly update the MindsDB image used by the extension to ensure access to the latest features and improvements. 

As mentioned previously, the extension uses the `mindsdb/mindsdb:latest` Docker image. To update the image, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the 'Images' tab in Docker Desktop.
2. Search or locate the mindsdb/mindsdb:latest image.
3. Click on the three dots on the right side of the image and click 'Pull'. If the image is already up to date, you will see a message stating so and you can skip the next step.
4. Wait for the image to be pulled and restart Docker Desktop.
