This section describes how to deploy MindsDB from the source code. It is the preferred way to use MindsDB if you want to contribute to our code or debug MindsDB.

<Tip>
To successfully install MindsDB, use **Python 64-bit version**. Also, make sure that **Python >= 3.9** and **pip >= 20.3**.
</Tip>

## Installation

<Tip>
Please note that this method of MindsDB installation requires a minimum of 6 GB free storage.
</Tip>

1. Clone the MindsDB repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb.git
   ```

2. Create a new virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv mindsdb-venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source mindsdb-venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd mindsdb
   pip install -e .
   pip install -r requirements/requirements-dev.txt
   ```

5. Start MindsDB:

   ```bash
   python -m mindsdb
   ```

By default, MindsDB will always start the `http` and `mysql` APIs. If you want to use Mongo API, you will need to provide that as a parameter to `--api`. You can do it as follows:

   ```bash
   python -m mindsdb --api=http,mongodb,mysql
   ```

6. Now, you can access the following:

<CodeGroup>

```bash MindsDB Studio
http://127.0.0.1:47334/
```

```bash MindsDB using MySQL
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 --port 3306 -u mindsdb -p
```

</CodeGroup>

## Dependencies

The dependencies for many of the data or ML integrations are not installed by default.

If you want to use a data or ML integration whose dependencies are not available by default, install it by running this command:

```
pip install mindsdb[handler_name]
```

<Tip>
You can find all available [handlers here](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/tree/main/mindsdb/integrations/handlers).
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Pip and Python Versions

Currently, MindsDB supports Python versions 3.9.x, 3.10.x, and 3.11.x.

To successfully install MindsDB, use **Python 64-bit version**. Also, make sure
that **Python >= 3.9** and **pip >= 20.3**. You can check the pip and python
versions by running the `pip --version` and
`python --version` commands.

Please note that depending on your environment and installed pip and python
packages, you might have to use **pip3** instead of **pip** or **python3.x**
instead of **py**. For example, `pip3 install mindsdb` instead of
`pip install mindsdb`.

### How to Avoid Dependency Issues

Install MindsDB in a virtual environment using **pip** to avoid dependency
issues.

### How to Avoid Common Errors

MindsDB requires around 3 GB of free disk space to install all of its
dependencies. Make sure to allocate min. 3 GB of disk space to avoid the
`IOError: [Errno 28] No space left on device while installing MindsDB` error.

Before anything, activate your virtual environment where your MindsDB is
installed. It is to avoid the `No module named mindsdb` error.

If you encounter the `This site can’t be reached. 127.0.0.1 refused to connect.`
error, please check the MindsDB server console to see if the server is still in
the `starting` phase. But if the server has started and you still get this
error, please report it on our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/issues).


## Further Issues?

You can try to use
[Docker setup](/setup/self-hosted/docker/) in case you are experiencing issues using pip.

Also, please create an issue with detailed description in the
[MindsDB GitHub repository](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/issues) so we can
help you. Usually, we review issues and respond within a few hours.

## What's Next

Now that you installed and started MindsDB locally in your Docker container, go ahead and find out how to create and train a model using the [`CREATE MODEL`](/sql/create/model) statement. In the **MindsDB SQL** section, you'll find a comprehensive overview of the SQL syntax offered by MindsDB. We also provide Mongo-QL syntax documented in the **MindsDB Mongo-QL** section.

You can connect MindsDB to different clients, including [PostgreSQL CLI](/connect/postgres-client) and [MySQL CLI](/connect/mysql-client).

Check out the [Use Cases](/use-cases/overview) section to follow tutorials that cover Large Language Models, Natural Language Processing, Time Series, Classification, and Regression models.
