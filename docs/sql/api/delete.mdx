## Description

The `DELETE` statement removes rows that fulfill the `WHERE` clause criteria.

## Syntax

Here is the syntax:

```sql
DELETE FROM integration_name.table_name
WHERE column_name = column_value_to_be_removed;
```

This statement removes all rows from the `table_name` table (that belongs to the `integration_name` integration) wherever the `column_name` column value is equal to `column_value_to_be_removed`.

And here is another way to filter the rows using a subquery:

```sql
DELETE FROM integration_name.table_name
WHERE column_name IN
                    (
                        SELECT column_value_to_be_removed
                        FROM some_integration.some_table
                        WHERE some_column = some_value
                    );
```

This statement removes all rows from the `table_name` table (that belongs to the `integration_name` integration) wherever the `column_name` column value is equal to one of the values returned by the subquery.
