## Description

The `SELECT * FROM files.file_name` statement is used to select data from a file.

First, you upload a file to the MindsDB Cloud Editor by following
[this guide](/sql/create/file/). And then, you can
[`CREATE MODEL`](/sql/create/model) from the uploaded file.

## Syntax

Here is the syntax:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM files.file_name;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| column | column | column | column |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| value  | value  | value  | value  |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
```

Where:

| Name          | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `file_name`   | Name of the file uploaded to the MindsDB Cloud Editor by following [this guide](/sql/create/file/). |
| `column`      | Name of the column from the file.                                                                   |

## Example

Once you uploaded your file by following [this guide](/sql/create/file/), you
can query it like a table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM files.home_rentals
LIMIT 10;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+-----------------+---------------------+-------+----------+----------------+---------------+--------------+--------------+
| number_of_rooms | number_of_bathrooms | sqft  | location | days_on_market | initial_price | neighborhood | rental_price |
+-----------------+---------------------+-------+----------+----------------+---------------+--------------+--------------+
| 0               | 1                   | 484,8 | great    | 10             | 2271          | south_side   | 2271         |
| 1               | 1                   | 674   | good     | 1              | 2167          | downtown     | 2167         |
| 1               | 1                   | 554   | poor     | 19             | 1883          | westbrae     | 1883         |
| 0               | 1                   | 529   | great    | 3              | 2431          | south_side   | 2431         |
| 3               | 2                   | 1219  | great    | 3              | 5510          | south_side   | 5510         |

| 1               | 1                   | 730   | good     | 0              | 2224          | downtown     | 2224         |
| 0               | 1                   | 298   | great    | 9              | 2104          | south_side   | 2104         |
| 2               | 1                   | 878   | great    | 8              | 3861          | south_side   | 3861         |
+-----------------+---------------------+-------+----------+----------------+---------------+--------------+--------------+
```

Now let's create a predictor using the uploaded file. You can learn more about
the [`CREATE MODEL` command here](/sql/create/model).

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.home_rentals_model
FROM files
    (SELECT * from home_rentals)
PREDICT rental_price;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (x.xxx sec)
```
