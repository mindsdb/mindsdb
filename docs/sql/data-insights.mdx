Data Insights is a data visualization feature of the MindsDB editor.

It lets you explore the queried data by initially displaying and analyzing a
subset of the first ten rows. You can choose to analyze a full dataset by
clicking the `Full Data Analysis` button. The analysis presents the distribution
of your data aggregated by column.

</p>

The data used here comes from one of our tutorials. For details, click
[here](/sql/tutorials/home-rentals/).

Before you see the Data Insights pane, you must run a `SELECT` query on your
dataset. Let's have a look at the available features.

## Features

### Distribution of Data per Column

When opening the Data Insights pane, you see the distribution of data of each
output dataset column. Initially, the visualization and analysis of the first
ten rows is shown, as below.

</p>

There is one histogram per column that depicts the column name, data types of
the distribution, and the distribution itself.

### `Potential Bias` Flag

To see the `Potential Bias` flag, enter a full-screen mode of the Data Insights
pane.

  <img src="/assets/sql/data-insights-3.png" />
</p>

Here, the `location` column exhibits potential bias, as there are more `great`
column values than `good` or `poor` column values. Such cases are typically
flagged. However, it does not necessarily mean that there is a problem with the
dataset.

The `Potential Bias` flag is used when data does not distribute normally or
uniformly, likely over-representing or under-representing some values. This may
be normal, hence, bias is only potential.

### `Missing Values` Flag

To see the `Missing Values` flag, enter a full-screen mode of the Data Insights
pane.

This flag indicates the proportion of missing values in a column. Columns with a
high percentage of missing values are not useful for modeling purposes. Hence,
it is recommended to pay attention to the `Missing Values` flag and try to
mitigate it whenever possible, as it indicates the degrading quality of your
data.

### Hovering Over the Histogram

When hovering over the histogram, you get the information on a particular column
value and how many of such values are present in a column. The format is
`(column_value, count)`.

It is helpful to determine the exact data value counts from the histograms.

## Full Data Analysis

Let's do a full data analysis step by step.

First, we need to query data for analysis in the MindsDB editor. Please
note that you need to query your dataset without using a `LIMIT` keyword to be
able to perform a complete data analysis.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM example_db.demo_data.home_rentals;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+---------------+-------------------+----+--------+--------------+--------------+------------+
|number_of_rooms|number_of_bathrooms|sqft|location|days_on_market|neighborhood  |rental_price|
+---------------+-------------------+----+--------+--------------+--------------+------------+
|2              |1                  |917 |great   |13            |berkeley_hills|3901        |
|0              |1                  |194 |great   |10            |berkeley_hills|2042        |
|1              |1                  |543 |poor    |18            |westbrae      |1871        |
|2              |1                  |503 |good    |10            |downtown      |3026        |
|3              |2                  |1066|good    |13            |thowsand_oaks |4774        |
+---------------+-------------------+----+--------+--------------+--------------+------------+
```

Now, open the Data Insights pane by clicking the `Data Insights` button to the
right of the output table. Initially, it shows the analysis of the first ten
rows of the output table.

</p>

To perform a complete analysis of your data, you can either go to a full-screen
mode or stay in a pane mode and click on the `Full Data Analysis` button. Below
is the complete data analysis.

Also, whenever your dataset changes, you can click on the
`Refresh Data Analysis` button to update the data visualization and analysis.
