## Description

The `DROP JOB` statement deletes the job.

## Syntax

Here is the syntax for deleting a job:

```sql
DROP JOB [project_name.]job_name;
```

The `project_name` value is optional. The `job_name` value indicates the job to be deleted.

Let's look at some examples:

```sql
DROP JOB my_project.retrain_and_save_job;
```

Here we drop the `retrain_and_save_job` that resides in the `my_project` project.

And another example:

```sql
DROP JOB create_table_job;
```

Here we drop the `create_table_job` job that resides in the current project.
