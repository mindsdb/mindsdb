sidebarTitle: House Sales with TimeGPT
---

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we introduce Nixtla’s TimeGPT integration which offers the first foundational model for time series forecasting.. We’ll go through an example to predict the real estate sales.

## Prerequisites

### MindsDB Setup

One way is to sign up for an account at [MindsDB Cloud](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/). It is a convenient option as it doesn’t require any installation procedures. You can find the details [here](/setup/cloud).

Alternatively, visit our docs and follow the instructions to manually set up a local instance of MindsDB via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [pip](/setup/self-hosted/pip/source). You can also set up MindsDB on AWS following [this instruction set](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-2nmhvskydmyrw).

### Creating an ML Engine

You can check the available engines with this command:

```sql
SHOW ML_ENGINES;
```

If you see the TimeGPT engine on the list, you are ready to follow the tutorials.

## Tutorial

### Connecting the Data

In this tutorial, we take our [House Sales tutorial](/sql/tutorials/house-sales-forecasting) and redo it using the StatsForecast engine.

We use a table from our MySQL public demo database, so let’s start by connecting MindsDB to it:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mysql_demo_db_houses
WITH ENGINE = 'mysql',
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "user",
    "password": "MindsDBUser123!",
    "host": "db-demo-data.cwoyhfn6bzs0.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
    "port": "3306",
    "database": "public"
};
```

Now that we’ve connected our database to MindsDB, let’s query the data to be used in the example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mysql_demo_db.house_sales
LIMIT 3;
```

Here is the output:

```sql
+----------+--------------------------+-----+--------+
|saledate  |house_price_moving_average|type |bedrooms|
+----------+--------------------------+-----+--------+
|30/09/2007|441854                    |house|2       |
|31/12/2007|441854                    |house|2       |
|31/03/2008|441854                    |house|2       |
+----------+--------------------------+-----+--------+
```

The `house_sales` table stores quarterly house price moving averages per property.

### Creating a Model

Let's create a model table to predict the house price moving average values:

```sql
CREATE MODEL nixtla_timegpt_house_sales_predictor
FROM mysql_demo_db
  (SELECT * FROM house_sales)
PREDICT house_price_moving_average
ORDER BY saledate
GROUP BY bedrooms, type
WINDOW 8
HORIZON 4
USING ENGINE = 'timegpt';
```

The syntax is the same as in the original tutorial. But here, we add the `USING` clause that specifies the ML engine used to make predictions.

We can check the training status with the following query:

```sql
DESCRIBE nixtla_timegpt_house_sales_predictor;
```

### Making Predictions

Once the model status is `complete`, the behavior is the same as with any other AI table – you can query for batch predictions by joining it with a data table:

```sql

SELECT m.saledate AS date, m.house_price_moving_average AS forecast
FROM nixtla_timegpt_house_sales_predictor AS m
JOIN mysql_demo_db.house_sales AS t
LIMIT 3;
```

Here is the output data:

```sql
+----------------------------+----------+
| date                       | forecast |
+----------------------------+----------+
| 2019-09-30 00:01:00.000000 | 335449.03125   |
| 2019-09-30 00:02:00.000000 | 335449.03125   |
| 2019-09-30 00:03:00.000000 | 335449.03125   |
+----------------------------+----------+
```
