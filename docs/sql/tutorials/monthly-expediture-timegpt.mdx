## Introduction

In this tutorial, we introduce Nixtla’s TimeGPT integration which offers the first foundational model for time series forecasting. Follow along to see how it works.

## Prerequisites

### MindsDB Setup

One way is to sign up for an account at [MindsDB Cloud](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/). It is a convenient option as it doesn’t require any installation procedures. You can find the details [here](/setup/cloud).

Alternatively, visit our docs and follow the instructions to manually set up a local instance of MindsDB via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [pip](/setup/self-hosted/pip/source). You can also set up MindsDB on AWS following [this instruction set](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-2nmhvskydmyrw).

### Creating an ML Engine

You can check the available engines with this command:

```sql
SHOW ML_ENGINES;
```

If you see the TimeGPT engine on the list, you are ready to follow the tutorials.

## Tutorial

### Connecting the Data

In this tutorial, we take our the Monthly Expenditures dataset.

We use a table from our MySQL public demo database, so let’s start by connecting MindsDB to it:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mysql_demo_db
WITH ENGINE = 'mysql',
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "user",
    "password": "MindsDBUser123!",
    "host": "db-demo-data.cwoyhfn6bzs0.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
    "port": "3306",
    "database": "public"
};
```

Now that we’ve connected our database to MindsDB, let’s query the data to be used in the example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mysql_demo_db.historical_expenditures
LIMIT 3;
```

Here is the output:

```sql
| month | category | expenditure |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1982-04-01 | food | 1162.6 |
| 1982-05-01 | food | 1150.9 |
| 1982-06-01 | food | 1160 |
```

### Creating a Model

Let's create a model table to predict the expenditure values:

```sql
CREATE MODEL nixtla_timegpt_quarterly_expenditure_forecaster
FROM mysql_demo_db
  (SELECT * FROM historical_expenditures)
PREDICT expenditure
ORDER BY month
GROUP BY category
WINDOW 12
HORIZON 3
USING ENGINE = 'timegpt';
```

We add the `USING` clause that specifies the ML engine used to make predictions.

We can check the training status with the following query:

```sql
DESCRIBE nixtla_timegpt_quarterly_expenditure_forecaster;
```

### Making Predictions

Once the model status is `complete`, the behavior is the same as with any other AI table – you can query for batch predictions by joining it with a data table:

```sql
SELECT m.month as month, m.expenditure as forecasted
FROM nixtla_timegpt_quarterly_expenditure_forecaster as m
JOIN mysql_demo_db.historical_expenditures as t
WHERE t.month > LATEST
AND t.category = 'food';
```

Here is the output data:

```sql
| month | forecasted |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 2017-09-01 00:01:00.000000 | 10307.9423828125 |
| 2017-09-01 00:02:00.000000 | 10307.931640625 |
| 2017-09-01 00:03:00.000000 | 10307.9384765625 |
```
