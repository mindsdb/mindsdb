## Pre-requisites

Before you start make sure that you've:

1. Visited [Getting Started Guide](/info)
2. Visited [Getting Started with Cloud](/deployment/cloud)
3. Downloaded the dataset. You can get it from
   [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/edumagalhaes/quality-prediction-in-a-mining-process).
4. Optional- Visual studio.

# Manufacturing process quality

Predicting process result quality is a common task in manufacturing analytics.
Manufacturing plants commonly use quality predictions to gain a competitive edge
over their competitors, improve their products or increase their customers
satisfaction. **MindsDB** is a tool that can help you solve quality prediction
tasks **easily** and **effectively** using machine learning. MindsDB abstracts
ML models as virtual “AI Tables” in databases and you can make predictions just
using normal SQL commands.

In this tutorial you will learn how to predict the quality of a mining process
using MindsDB.

## Upload a file

1. Fix headers:
   - `sed -e 's/ /_/g' -e 's/\(.*\)/\L\1/' -e 's/%_//g' MiningProcess_Flotation_Plant_Database.csv > fixed_headers.csv`
     (for Linux/Unix)
   - edit headers manually: change `space` to `underscore`, upper case to lower
     case, remove `%` from headers (for Windows)
2. Access MindsDB GUI on local via URL 127.0.0.1:47334/.
3. If you are using MindsDB Cloud, make sure to add the file to a database and
   create a database connection to MindsDB's GUI. Cloud has a file size limit of
   10MB, therefore for this dataset it would be best to either use MindsDB local
   instance or if on Cloud
   [connect via a database.](/sql/create/databases/)
4. Select the `Add data` button or the plug icon on the left side bar.
5. The page will navigate to the 'Select your data source' page. Select 'Files'.
6. Under 'Import a file' select the tab 'Click here to browse local files' and
   select your data file.
7. Once the file is uploaded 100%, provide a name for the data file that will be
   saved as a table.
8. Select the button Save and Continue.

You can query the file that has been uploaded to see that the data does pull
through.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM files.file_name;
```

## Connect to MindsDB SQL Sever

MindsDB's GUI has a SQL Editor that allows you to create and train predictors
and also makes predictions. However you can also do this via the mysql client in
a local terminal by accessing MindsDB SQL Server.

1.

```sql
mysql -h cloud.mindsdb.com --port 3306 -u username@email.com -p
```

2.

```sql
USE mindsdb;
```

## Create a predictor

In this section you will connect to MindsDB with the MySql API and create a
Predictor. It is in MindsDB terms a machine learning model, but all its
complexity is automated and abstracted as a virtual “AI Table”. If you are an ML
expert and want to tweak the model, MindsDB also allows you that (please refer
to documentation).

Use the following query to create a Predictor that will foretell the
silica_concentrate at the end of our mining process.

> The row number is limited to 5000 to speed up training but you can keep the
> whole dataset.

```sql
CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb.process_quality_predictor
FROM files (
    SELECT iron_feed, silica_feed, starch_flow, amina_flow, ore_pulp_flow,
           ore_pulp_ph, ore_pulp_density,flotation_column_01_air_flow,
           flotation_column_02_air_flow, flotation_column_03_air_flow,
           flotation_column_04_air_flow, flotation_column_05_air_flow,
           flotation_column_06_air_flow,flotation_column_07_air_flow,
           flotation_column_01_level, flotation_column_02_level,
           flotation_column_03_level, flotation_column_04_level,
           flotation_column_05_level, flotation_column_06_level,
           flotation_column_07_level, iron_concentrate, silica_concentrate
    FROM process_quality
    LIMIT 5000
) PREDICT silica_concentrate;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (2 min 27.52 sec)
```

Now the Predictor will begin training. You can check the status with the
following query.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mindsdb.predictors
WHERE name='process_quality_predictor';
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+-----------------------------+----------+----------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------+
| name                        | status   | accuracy | predict            | select_data_query | training_options |
+-----------------------------+----------+----------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------+
| process_quality_predictor   | complete | 1        | silica_concentrate |                   |                  |
+-----------------------------+----------+----------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------+
1 row in set (0.28 sec)
```

As you can see the accuracy of the model is 1 (i.e. 100%). This is the result of
using a limited dataset of 5000 rows. In reality when using the whole dataset,
you will probably see a more reasonable accuracy.

You are now done with creating the predictor! ✨

## Make predictions

In this section you will learn how to make predictions using your trained model.

To run a prediction against new or existing data, you can use the following
query.

```sql
SELECT silica_concentrate, silica_concentrate_confidence, silica_concentrate_explain
FROM mindsdb.process_quality_predictor
WHERE iron_feed=48.81
AND silica_feed=25.31
AND starch_flow=2504.94
AND amina_flow=309.448
AND ore_pulp_flow=377.6511682692
AND ore_pulp_ph=10.0607
AND ore_pulp_density=1.68676;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+--------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| silica_concentrate | silica_concentrate_confidence | Info                                                                                                                                            |
+--------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1.68               | 0.99                          | {"predicted_value": "1.68", "confidence": 0.99, "confidence_lower_bound": null, "confidence_upper_bound": null, "anomaly": null, "truth": null} |
+--------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.81 sec)
```

As you can see, the model predicted the `silica concentrate` for our data point.
Again we can see a very high confidence due to the limited dataset. When making
predictions you can include different fields. As you can notice, we have only
included the first 7 fields of our dataset. You are free to test different
combinations.

In the previous example, we have made a prediction for a single data point. In a
real scenario, you might want to make predictions on multiple data points. In
this case, MindsDB allows you to Join this other table with the Predictor. In
result, you will get another table as an output with a predicted value as one of
its columns.

Let’s see how to make batch predictions.

Use the following command to create the batch prediction.

```sql
SELECT
    collected_data.iron_feed,
    collected_data.silica_feed,
    collected_data.starch_flow,
    collected_data.amina_flow,
    collected_data.ore_pulp_flow,
    collected_data.ore_pulp_ph,
    collected_data.ore_pulp_density,
    predictions.silica_concentrate_confidence AS confidence,
    predictions.silica_concentrate AS predicted_silica_concentrate
FROM process_quality_integration.process_quality AS collected_data
JOIN mindsdb.process_quality_predictor AS predictions
LIMIT 5;
```

As you can see below, the predictor has made multiple predictions for each data
point in the `collected_data` table! You can also try selecting other fields to
get more insight on the predictions. See the
[JOIN clause documentation](/sql/api/join/) for more
information.

```sql
+-----------+-------------+-------------+------------+---------------+-------------+------------------+------------+------------------------------+
| iron_feed | silica_feed | starch_flow | amina_flow | ore_pulp_flow | ore_pulp_ph | ore_pulp_density | confidence | predicted_silica_concentrate |
+-----------+-------------+-------------+------------+---------------+-------------+------------------+------------+------------------------------+
