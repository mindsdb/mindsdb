Augmenting Intercom Chats with GPT for Sentiment Analysis
---

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll analyze sentiment of Intercom conversations. We'll use Airbyte to extract data from Intercom and store it into a Google BigQuery database. Then, we'll make this data available to MindsDB, create and deploy a GPT model within MindsDB, and join both data and a model to predict the sentiment values to be further analyzed in business analytics tools.

## Data Setup

We use Airbyte to pull data from Intercom and load it into a Google BigQuery database.

You can try [Airbyte Cloud](https://airbyte.com/airbyte-cloud) or use the [Airbyte Open Source](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte) version.

Follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ejCUKC9K7U) or [this detailed tutorial]() to learn how to pull conversation data from Intercom and load it into a Google BigQuery database using Airbyte and visualize it using Metabase analytics.

## Connecting a Database

Now you can connect the Google BigQuery database that stores the Intercom data to MindsDB.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE bqdataset
WITH
   engine = "bigquery",
   parameters = {
      "project_id": "bgtest-1111",
      "dataset": "mydataset",
      "service_account_keys": "/tmp/keys.json"
   };
```

Follow [this instruction](https://docs.mindsdb.com/data-integrations/google-bigquery) to connect your database to MindsDB.

## Creating a model

Let's create a GPT model that we'll use to predict sentiment of Intercom conversations.

```sql
CREATE MODEL sentiment_classifier_model
PREDICT sentiment
USING
    engine = 'openai',
    model_name = 'text-davinci-003',
    prompt_template = 'describe the user sentiment from the following conversation STRICTLY as positive or neutral or negative.\n###\n{{full_conversation}}     \n###\nSentiment [positive/neutral/negative]:';
```

Here is how we can check its status:

```sql
DESCRIBE sentiment_classifier_model;
```

Once the status is complete, we can proceeed to make predictions.

## Making batch predictions

Now we join our data table (joined_conversations) that stores Intercom conversations with the model (sentiment_classifier_model) created in MindsDB. That's how we can make batch predictions for all conversations at once.

```sql
SELECT 
        joined_conversations.conversation_id,
        -- joined_conversations.full_conversation,
        sentiments.sentiment

FROM

    -- data table that stores conversations
    (
        -- using native bigquery syntax
        SELECT * FROM bqdataset (
            SELECT
            conversation_id,
            STRING_AGG(p.body, "\n" ORDER BY p.created_at ASC LIMIT 15) AS full_conversation,
            FROM conversation_parts p
            WHERE
            JSON_VALUE(p.author, '$.type') = 'user'
            GROUP BY conversation_id LIMIT 10
        )
    ) AS joined_conversations

JOIN

    -- model that analyzes sentiment
    sentiment_classifier_model AS sentiments;
```

Run it in the MindsDB editor to find out the output.
