MindsDB provides a custom syntax to build AI agents that comprises an AI model augmented with users' data access. AI agents can be connected to a chat interface, like Slack or MS Teams, to create chatbots.

See details following [this link for Agents](/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent) and [this link for Chatbots](/mindsdb_sql/agents/chatbot).

## Step-by-Step Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates how to build AI agents with MindsDB using MindsDB SQL editor. This can be also accomplished with [APIs](/rest/agents/create-agent) and [Python SDK](/sdks/python/agents).

Let's list all the steps required to build an AI agent.

The following sections walk you through the process of building an AI agent.

## Step 1. Create a conversational model

Use the `CREATE MODEL` statement below to create a conversational model. If required, adjust the parameters and prompts to fit your use case.

```sql
CREATE MODEL conversational_model
PREDICT answer
USING
    engine = 'langchain',
    openai_api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE',
    model_name = 'gpt-4',
    mode = 'conversational',
    user_column = 'question' ,
    assistant_column = 'answer',
    max_tokens = 100,
    temperature = 0,
    verbose = True,
    prompt_template = 'Answer the user input in a helpful way';
```

Ensure that the model status reads `complete` using this command:

```sql
DESCRIBE conversational_model;
```

Learn more about [models created with LangChain](/integrations/ai-engines/langchain).

## Step 2. Create skills

A skill is essentially users' data fed to the model, so the model can answer questions over users' data.

First, connect your database to MindsDB. Here the sample database is used.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE datasource
WITH ENGINE = "postgres",
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "demo_user",
    "password": "demo_password",
    "host": "samples.mindsdb.com",
    "port": "5432",
    "database": "demo",
    "schema": "demo_data"
};
```

Create a skill using the connected data.

```sql
CREATE SKILL text2sql_skill
USING
    type = 'text2sql',
    database = 'datasource', -- connect your database with CREATE DATABASE and pass its name here
    tables = ['car_sales'], -- list table(s) to be made accessible by an agent
    description = 'this is car sales data';
```

Note that there are two types of skills: text-to-SQL and knowledge bases. Learn more about [skills here](/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent#create-skills).

Verify that the skill has been created successully using this command:

```sql
SHOW SKILLS;
```

## Step 3. Create an AI agent

Now that both the conversational model and the skill are ready, let's create an AI agent.

```sql
CREATE AGENT ai_agent
USING
    model = 'conversational_model',
    skills = ['text2sql_skill'];
```

Verify that the agent has been created successully using this command:

```sql
SHOW AGENTS;
```

At this point, you can query an agent to ask questions over the data.

```sql
SELECT question, answer
FROM ai_agent
WHERE question = 'how many cars were sold in 2016?';
```

## Step 4. Create a chatbot

Optionally, you can create a chatbot by connecitng an AI agent to a chat interface.

First connect a chat interface to MindsDB. Here the Slack connection is made.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_slack
WITH
  ENGINE = 'slack',
  PARAMETERS = {
      "token": "xoxb-xxx",
      "app_token": "xapp-xxx"
    };
```

Follow the instructions on how to [connect Slack to MindsDB](/integrations/app-integrations/slack#method-1-chatbot-responds-in-direct-messages-to-a-slack-app) for this use case.

Now create a chatbot providing the AI agent and the Slack connection.

```sql
CREATE CHATBOT ai_chatbot
USING
    database = 'mindsdb_slack', -- connect a chat interface with CREATE DATABASE
    agent = 'ai_agent'; -- create an agent with with CREATE AGENT
```

Verify that the chatbot is running using this command:

```sql
SHOW CHATBOTS;
```

Now you can go ahead and chat with the AI agent via Slack.
