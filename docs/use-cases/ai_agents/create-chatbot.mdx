MindsDB provides the `CREATE CHATBOT` statement that lets you customize your chatbot with an AI model and a data source of your choice. Follow this tutorial to learn build a chatbot with a Text2SQL skill.

The `CREATE CHATBOT` statement requires the following componenets:

1. **Chat app**: A connection to a chat app, such as [Slack](/integrations/app-integrations/slack#method-1-chatbot-responds-in-direct-messages-to-a-slack-app) or [MS Teams](/integrations/app-integrations/microsoft-teams).

2. **AI agent**: An AI agent that comes with an AI model trained with the provided training data. Learn more about [AI agents here](/agents/agent).

Let's go over getting all the components ready.

## Chatbot Components

### Chat App

Use the `CREATE DATABASE` statement to connect the chat app to MindsDB.

<Tip>
If you want to use Slack, follow [this link](/integrations/app-integrations/slack#method-1-chatbot-responds-in-direct-messages-to-a-slack-app) to setup a Slack app, generate required tokens, and connect it to MindsDB.

If you want to use MS Teams, follow [this link](/integrations/app-integrations/microsoft-teams) to generate required tokens and connect it to MindsDB.
</Tip>

### AI Agent

Start by creating and deploying the model.

<Note>
If you haven't created a LangChain engine, use the `CREATE ML_ENGINE` statement, as explained [here](/integrations/ai-engines/langchain#ai-engine).
</Note>

```sql
CREATE MODEL my_model
PREDICT answer
USING
    engine = 'langchain',
    input_column = 'question',
    openai_api_key = 'your-model-api-key', -- choose one of OpenAI (openai_api_key) or Anthropic (anthropic_api_key)
    model_name='gpt-4', -- optional model name from OpenAI or Anthropic
    mode = 'conversational',
    user_column = 'question' ,
    assistant_column = 'answer',
    max_tokens=100,
    temperature=0,
    verbose=True,
    prompt_template='Answer the user input in a helpful way';
```

Here is the command to check its status:

```sql
DESCRIBE my_model;
```

The status should read `complete` before proceeding.

Next step is to create one or more skills for an AI agent. Here we create a Text2SQL skill.

```sql
CREATE SKILL text_to_sql_skill
USING
    type = 'text2sql',
    database = 'example_db',   -- this is a data source that must be connected to MindsDB with CREATE DATABASE statement
    tables = ['sales_data'],   -- this table comes from the connected example_db data source
    description = "Sales data that includes stores, sold products, and other sale details";
```

This skill enables a model to answer questions about data from the `sales_data` table.

Now let's create an AI agent using the above model and skill.

```sql
CREATE AGENT support_agent
USING
model = 'my_model',                  -- this was created with CREATE MODEL
skills = ['text_to_sql_skill'];    -- this was created with CREATE SKILL
```

## Create Chatbot

Once all the components are ready, let's proceed to creating the chatbot.

```sql
CREATE CHATBOT my_chatbot
USING
   database = 'chat_app',     -- this parameters stores a connection to a chat app, like Slack or MS Teams
   agent = 'support_agent',   -- this parameter stores an agent name, which was create with CREATE AGENT
   enable_dms = true,         -- this parameter is optional and enable direct messages with the chatbot
   running = true;            -- this parameter is optional and set to true by default, meaning that the chatbot is running
```

The `database` parameter stores connection to a chat app. And the `agent` parameter stores an AI agent created by passing a model and training data.

You can query all chatbot using this query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM chatbots;
```

Now you can go to Slack or MS Teams and chat with the chatbot created with MindsDB.
