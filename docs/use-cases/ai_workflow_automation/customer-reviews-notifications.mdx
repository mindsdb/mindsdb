This tutorial presents how to chain OpenAI models within MindsDB to analyze text sentiment and generate responses, which will be sent in the form of Slack notifications.

## Data setup

Connect your database to MindsDB.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE local_postgres
WITH ENGINE = 'postgres',
PARAMETERS = {
    "host": "4.tcp.eu.ngrok.io",
    "port": 12888,
    "database": "postgres",
    "user": "postgres",
    "password": "password"
    };
```

Query the input data table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM local_postgres.demo.amazon_reviews;
```

```sql
+----------------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+
| created_at                 | product_name                | review                 |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+
| 2023-11-08 17:23:21.028485 | Power Adapter               | It is a great product. |
| 2023-11-08 17:23:21.028485 | Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Speaker | It is ok.              |
| 2023-11-08 17:23:21.028485 | Kindle eReader              | It doesn’t work.       |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+
```

## Model 1 setup

Configure an AI engine, providing the OpenAI API key.

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE openai_engine
FROM openai
USING
    openai_api_key = 'sk-xxx';
```

Deploy a model using this AI engine.

```sql
CREATE MODEL sentiment_classifier
PREDICT sentiment
USING
    engine = 'openai_engine',
    model_name = 'gpt-4',
    prompt_template = 'describe the sentiment of the reviews
    strictly as "positive", "neutral", or "negative".
    "I love the product":positive
    "It is a scam":negative
    "{{review}}.":';
```

Check its status.

```sql
DESCRIBE sentiment_classifier;
```

## Predictions from Model 1

You can make a single predictions, providing input to the mode in the `WHERE` clause.

```sql
SELECT review, sentiment
FROM sentiment_classifier
WHERE review = 'It is ok.';
```

Or, make batch predictions, joining the data table with the model.

```sql
SELECT input.review, output.sentiment
FROM local_postgres.demo.amazon_reviews AS input
JOIN sentiment_classifier AS output;
```

## Automation

The alert system will send notification to Slack. Here is how to [connect Slack to MindsDB](/integrations/app-integrations/slack#method-2-chatbot-responds-on-a-defined-slack-channel).

```sql
CREATE DATABASE customer_reviews_slack_app
WITH
ENGINE = 'slack',
PARAMETERS =  {
    "token": "xoxb-xxx" 
};
```

Send a test message to test the connection.

```sql
INSERT INTO customer_reviews_slack_app.messages (channel_id, text)
VALUES("customer-reviews-channel-id", "Testing Slack connection");
```

[Create a job](/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/jobs) to send notification every time a negative review is received.

```sql
CREATE JOB customer_reviews_notifications (

    INSERT INTO customer_reviews_slack_app.messages (channel_id, text)
        SELECT "customer-reviews-channel-id" as channel_id,
                concat('Product: ', input.product_name, chr(10), 'Received negative review at: ', input.created_at, chr(10), 'Review: ', input.review) as text
        FROM local_postgres.demo.amazon_reviews AS input
        JOIN sentiment_classifier AS output
        WHERE input.created_at > LAST
        AND output.sentiment = 'negative'
)
EVERY 1 minute;
```

These commands are used to monitor the job.

```sql
SHOW JOBS WHERE name = 'customer_reviews_notifications';

SELECT * FROM mindsdb.jobs WHERE name = 'customer_reviews_notifications';

SELECT * FROM log.jobs_history WHERE project = 'mindsdb' AND name = 'customer_reviews_notifications';
```

Use this command to disable the job.

```sql
DROP JOB customer_reviews_notifications;
```

## Model 2 setup

Deploy a model using the AI engine created earlier.

```sql
CREATE MODEL response_model
PREDICT response
USING
    engine = 'openai_engine',
    model_name = 'gpt-4',
    prompt_template = 'briefly respond to the customer review: {{review}}';
```

Check its status.

```sql
DESCRIBE response_model;
```

## Predictions from Model 2

You can make a single predictions, providing input to the mode in the `WHERE` clause.

```sql
SELECT review, response
FROM response_model
WHERE review = 'It is ok.';
```

Or, make batch predictions, joining the data table with the model.

```sql
SELECT input.review, output.response
FROM local_postgres.demo.amazon_reviews AS input
JOIN response_model AS output;
```

## Automation and Chaining Models 1 & 2

[Create a job](/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/jobs) to send notification, including a sample response, every time a positive review is received.

```sql
CREATE JOB customer_reviews_and_responses_notifications (

    INSERT INTO customer_reviews_slack_app.messages (channel_id, text)
        SELECT "customer-reviews-channel-id" as channel_id,
                concat('---------', chr(10),
                       'Product: ', input.product_name, chr(10), 
                       'Received ', input.sentiment, ' review at: ', input.created_at, chr(10), 
                       'Review: ', input.review, chr(10), 
                       'Sample response: ', output.response) as text
        FROM (SELECT inp.created_at AS created_at, inp.product_name AS product_name, inp.review AS review, outp.sentiment AS sentiment
              FROM local_postgres.demo.amazon_reviews AS inp
              JOIN sentiment_classifier AS outp
              WHERE inp.created_at > LAST) AS input --'2023-10-03 16:50:00' AND inp.created_at > "{{PREVIOUS_START_DATETIME}}"
        JOIN response_model AS output
        WHERE input.sentiment = 'positive';
)
EVERY 1 minute;
```

These commands are used to monitor the job.

```sql
SELECT * FROM mindsdb.jobs WHERE name = 'customer_reviews_and_responses_notifications';

SELECT * FROM log.jobs_history WHERE project = 'mindsdb' AND name = 'customer_reviews_and_responses_notifications';
```

Use this command to disable the job.

```sql
DROP JOB customer_reviews_and_responses_notifications;
```
