In this example, we again use our sample PostgreSQL database.

First, we create and train the model using a subset of the `customer_churn` data, considering only female customers.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.adjust_customer_churn_model
FROM example_db
    (SELECT *
    FROM demo_data.customer_churn
    WHERE gender = 'Female')
PREDICT churn;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query successfully completed
```

We can check its status using this command:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mindsdb.models
WHERE name = 'adjust_customer_churn_model';
```

Once the status is complete, we can query for predictions.

```sql
SELECT churn, churn_explain
FROM mindsdb.adjust_customer_churn_model
WHERE seniorcitizen = 0
AND partner = 'Yes'
AND dependents = 'No'
AND tenure = 1
AND phoneservice = 'No'
AND multiplelines = 'No phone service'
AND internetservice = 'DSL';
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| churn  | churn_explain                                                                                                                                              |
+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| No     | {"predicted_value": "No", "confidence": 0.9887640449438202, "anomaly": null, "truth": null, "probability_class_No": 0.934, "probability_class_Yes": 0.066} |
+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
 
Let’s adjust this model with more training data. Now we also consider male customers.

```sql
FINETUNE mindsdb.adjust_customer_churn_model
FROM example_db
    (SELECT *
    FROM demo_data.customer_churn
    WHERE gender = 'Male');
```

<Warning>
While the model is being generated and trained, it is not active. The model becomes active only after it completes generating and training.
</Warning>

To check the status and versions of the model, run this command:

```sql
SELECT name, engine, project, active, version, status
FROM mindsdb.models_versions
WHERE name = 'adjust_customer_churn_model';
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+-----------------------------+-----------+---------+--------+---------+----------+
| name                        | engine    | project | active | version | status   |
+-----------------------------+-----------+---------+--------+---------+----------+
| adjust_customer_churn_model | lightwood | mindsdb | false  | 1       | complete |
| adjust_customer_churn_model | lightwood | mindsdb | true   | 2       | complete |
+-----------------------------+-----------+---------+--------+---------+----------+
```

Let’s query for a prediction again.

```sql
SELECT churn, churn_explain
FROM mindsdb.adjust_customer_churn_model
WHERE seniorcitizen = 0
AND partner = 'Yes'
AND dependents = 'No'
AND tenure = 1
AND phoneservice = 'No'
AND multiplelines = 'No phone service'
AND internetservice = 'DSL';
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| churn  | churn_explain                                                                                                                                                |
+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| No     | {"predicted_value": "No", "confidence": 0.9887640449438202, "anomaly": null, "truth": null, "probability_class_No": 0.9294, "probability_class_Yes": 0.0706} |
+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Here after adjusting the model, there are no significant changes to the predictions. However, the probability class for `Yes` and `No` values has been updated. The probability of a `Yes` value has increased slightly, while the probability of a `No` value has decreased.

<Tip>
If you have dynamic data that gets updated regularly, you can set up an automated fine-tuning as below.

Note that the data source must contain an incremental column, such as timestamp or integer, so MindsDB can pick up only the recently added data.

Create a view to store recently added data with the help of the [`LAST` keyword](/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/jobs#last):

```sql
CREATE VIEW recent_data (
    SELECT *
    FROM example_db.customer_churn
    WHERE timestamp > LAST
);
```

Create a job to fine-tune the model periodically.

```sql
CREATE JOB automated_finetuning (

    FINETUNE adjust_customer_churn_model
    FROM mindsdb
        (SELECT * FROM recent_data)
)
EVERY 1 day;
```

Now your model will be fine-tuned with newly added data every day.
