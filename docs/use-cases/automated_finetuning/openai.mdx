In this example we are going to **teach an OpenAI model, how to write MindsDB AI SQL queries**

All OpenAI models belong to the group of Large Language Models (LLMs). By definition, these are pre-trained on large amounts of data. However, it is possible to fine-tune these models with a task-specific dataset for a defined use case.

<Tip>
OpenAI supports fine-tuning of some of its models [listed here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning). And with MindsDB, you can easily fine-tune an OpenAI model making it more applicable to your specific use case.
</Tip>

Let's create a model to answer questions about MindsDB's custom SQL syntax.

First, create an OpenAI engine, passing your OpenAI API key:

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE openai_engine
FROM openai
USING
    openai_api_key = 'your-openai-api-key';
```

Then, create a model using this engine:

```sql
CREATE MODEL openai_davinci
PREDICT completion
USING
    engine = 'openai_engine',
    model_name = 'davinci-002',
    prompt_template = 'Return a valid SQL string for the following question about MindsDB in-database machine learning: {{prompt}}';
```

You can check model status with this command:

```sql
DESCRIBE openai_davinci;
```

Once the status is complete, we can query for predictions:

```sql
SELECT prompt, completion
FROM openai_davinci as m
WHERE prompt = 'What is the SQL syntax to join input data with predictions from a MindsDB machine learning model?'
USING max_tokens=400;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| prompt                                                                                            | completion                                                                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| What is the SQL syntax to join input data with predictions from a MindsDB machine learning model? | The SQL syntax is: SELECT * FROM input_data INNER JOIN predictions ON input_data.id = predictions.id |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

If you followed one of the MindsDB tutorials before, you'll see that the syntax provided by the model is not exactly as expected.

Now, we'll fine-tune our model using a table that stores details about MindsDB's custom SQL syntax.

<Info>
Upload [this data file](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/staging/docs/use-cases/automated_finetuning/data.csv) to MindsDB and use it to finetune the model.
</Info>

This is how you can fine-tune an OpenAI model:

```sql
FINETUNE openai_davinci
FROM files
    (SELECT prompt, completion FROM openai_learninghub_ft);
```

The [`FINETUNE`](/sql/api/finetune) command creates a new version of the `openai_davinci` model. You can query all available versions as below:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM models_versions
WHERE name = 'openai_davinci';
```

<Warning>
While the model is being generated and trained, it is not active. The model becomes active only after it completes generating and training.
</Warning>

Once the new version status is complete and active, we can query the model again, expecting a more accurate output.

```sql
SELECT prompt, completion
FROM openai_davinci as m
WHERE prompt = 'What is the SQL syntax to join input data with predictions from a MindsDB machine learning model?'
USING max_tokens=400;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| prompt                                                                                            | completion                                                                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| What is the SQL syntax to join input data with predictions from a MindsDB machine learning model? | SELECT * FROM mindsdb.models.my_model JOIN mindsdb.input_data_name;                                  |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

<Tip>
If you have dynamic data that gets updated regularly, you can set up an automated fine-tuning as below.

Note that the data source must contain an incremental column, such as timestamp or integer, so MindsDB can pick up only the recently added data.

Create a view to store recently added data with the help of the [`LAST` keyword](/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/jobs#last):

```sql
CREATE VIEW recent_data (
    SELECT *
    FROM files.openai_learninghub_ft
    WHERE timestamp > LAST
);
```

Create a job to fine-tune the model periodically.

```sql
CREATE JOB automated_finetuning (

    FINETUNE openai_davinci
    FROM mindsdb
        (SELECT * FROM recent_data)
)
EVERY 1 day;
```

Now your model will be fine-tuned with newly added data every day.
