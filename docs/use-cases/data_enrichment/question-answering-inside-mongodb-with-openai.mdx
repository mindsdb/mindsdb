## Introduction

In this blog post, we present how to create OpenAI models within MindsDB. In this example, we ask a question to a model and get an answer. The input data is taken from our sample MongoDB database.

## Prerequisites

To follow along, install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).

## How to Connect MindsDB to a Database

We use a collection from our MongoDB public demo database, so let’s start by connecting MindsDB to it.

You can use [Mongo Compass](/connect/mongo-compass) or [Mongo Shell](/connect/mongo-shell) to connect our sample database like this:

```bash
test> use mindsdb
mindsdb> db.databases.insertOne({
            'name': 'mongo_demo_db',
            'engine': 'mongodb',
            'connection_args': {
                "host": "mongodb+srv://user:MindsDBUser123!@demo-data-mdb.trzfwvb.mongodb.net/",
                "database": "public"
            }
        })
```

## Tutorial

In this tutorial, we create a predictive model to answer questions in a specified domain.

Now that we've connected our database to MindsDB, let’s query the data to be used in the example:

```bash
mindsdb> use mongo_demo_db
mongo_demo_db> db.questions.find({}).limit(3)
```

Here is the output:

```bash
{
  _id: '63d01350bbca62e9c77732c0',
  article_title: 'Alessandro_Volta',
  question: 'Was Volta an Italian physicist?',
  true_answer: 'yes'
}
{
  _id: '63d01350bbca62e9c77732c1',
  article_title: 'Alessandro_Volta',
  question: 'Is Volta buried in the city of Pittsburgh?',
  true_answer: 'no'
}
{
  _id: '63d01350bbca62e9c77732c2',
  article_title: 'Alessandro_Volta',
  question: 'Did Volta have a passion for the study of electricity?',
  true_answer: 'yes'
}
```

Let's create a model collection to answer all questions from the input dataset:

<Note>
Note that you need to create an OpenAI engine first before deploying the OpenAI model within MindsDB.

Here is how to create this engine:

```bash
mongo_demo_db> use mindsdb
mindsdb> db.ml_engines.insertOne(
          {
              "name": "openai_engine",
              "handler": "openai",
              "params": {
                  "openai_api_key": "your-openai-api-key"
                  }
          })
```
</Note>

```bash
mongo_demo_db> use mindsdb
mindsdb> db.models.insertOne({
            name: 'question_answering',
            predict: 'answer',
            training_options: {
                        engine: 'openai_engine',
                        prompt_template: 'answer the question of text:{{question}} about text:{{article_title}}'
                }
        })
```

In practice, the `insertOne` method triggers MindsDB to generate an AI collection called `question_answering` that uses the OpenAI integration to predict a field named `answer`. The model is created inside the default `mindsdb` project. In MindsDB, projects are a natural way to keep artifacts, such as models or views, separate according to what predictive task they solve. You can learn more about MindsDB projects [here](/sql/project).

The `training_options` key specifies the parameters that this handler requires.

- The `engine` parameter defines that we use the `openai` engine.
- The `prompt_template` parameter conveys the structure of a message that is to be completed with additional text generated by the model.

<Note>
Follow [this instruction](/integrations/ai-engines/openai#setup) to set up the OpenAI integration in MindsDB.
</Note>

Once the `insertOne` method has started execution, we can check the status of the creation process with the following query:

```bash
mindsdb> db.models.find({
            'name': 'question_answering'
        })
```

It may take a while to register as complete depending on the internet connection. Once the creation is complete, the behavior is the same as with any other AI collection – you can query it either by specifying synthetic data in the actual query:

```bash
mindsdb> db.question_answering.find({
            question: 'Was Abraham Lincoln the sixteenth President of the United States?',
            article_title: 'Abraham_Lincoln'
        })
```

Here is the output data:

```bash
{
  answer: 'Yes, Abraham Lincoln was the sixteenth President of the United States.',
  question: 'Was Abraham Lincoln the sixteenth President of the United States?',
  article_title: 'Abraham_Lincoln'
}
```

Or by joining with a collection for batch predictions:

```bash
mindsdb> db.question_answering.find(
            {
                'collection': 'mongo_demo_db.questions'
            },
            {
                'question_answering.answer': 'answer',
                'questions.question': 'question',
                'questions.article_title': 'article_title'
            }
        ).limit(3)
```

Here is the output data:

```bash
{
  answer: 'Yes, Volta was an Italian physicist.',
  question: 'Was Volta an Italian physicist?',
  article_title: 'Alessandro_Volta'
}
{
  answer: 'No, Volta is not buried in the city of Pittsburgh.',
  question: 'Is Volta buried in the city of Pittsburgh?',
  article_title: 'Alessandro_Volta'
}
{
  answer: 'Yes, Volta had a passion for the study of electricity. He was fascinated by the',
  question: 'Did Volta have a passion for the study of electricity?',
  article_title: 'Alessandro_Volta'
}
```

The `questions` collection is used to make batch predictions. Upon joining the `question_answering` model with the `questions` collection, the model uses all values from the `article_title` and `question` fields.
