## Introduction

In this blog post, we present how to create OpenAI models within MindsDB. In this example, we ask a model to provide a summary of a text. The input data is taken from our sample MySQL database.

## Prerequisites

To follow along, install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).

## Tutorial

In this tutorial, we create a predictive model to summarize an article.

We use a table from our MySQL public demo database, so let's start by connecting MindsDB to it:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mysql_demo_db
WITH ENGINE = 'mysql',
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "user",
    "password": "MindsDBUser123!",
    "host": "samples.mindsdb.com",
    "port": "3306",
    "database": "public"
};
```

Now that we've connected our database to MindsDB, let's query the data to be used in the example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mysql_demo_db.articles
LIMIT 3;
```

Here is the output:

```sql
+----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| article                                                        | highlights                                                   |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Video footage has emerged of a law enforcement officer…        | The 53-second video features…                                |
| A new restaurant is offering a five-course drink-paired menu…  | The Curious Canine Kitchen is…                               |
| Mother-of-two Anna Tilley survived after spending four days…   | Experts have warned hospitals not using standard treatment…  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Let's create a model table to summarize all articles from the input dataset:

<Tip>
Before creating an OpenAI model, please create an engine, providing your OpenAI API key:

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE openai_engine
FROM openai
USING
	openai_api_key = 'your-openai-api-key';
```
</Tip>

```sql
CREATE MODEL text_summarization_model
PREDICT highlights
USING
    engine = 'openai_engine',              
    prompt_template = 'provide an informative summary of the text text:{{article}} using full sentences';
```

In practice, the `CREATE MODEL` statement triggers MindsDB to generate an AI table called `text_summarization_model` that uses the OpenAI integration to predict a column named `highlights`. The model lives inside the default `mindsdb` project. In MindsDB, projects are a natural way to keep artifacts, such as models or views, separate according to what predictive task they solve. You can learn more about MindsDB projects [here](/sql/project).

The `USING` clause specifies the parameters that this handler requires.

- The `engine` parameter defines that we use the `openai` engine.
- The `prompt_template` parameter conveys the structure of a message that is to be completed with additional text generated by the model.

<Note>
Follow [this instruction](/integrations/ai-engines/openai#setup) to set up the OpenAI integration in MindsDB.
</Note>

Once the `CREATE MODEL` statement has started execution, we can check the status of the creation process with the following query:

```sql
DESCRIBE text_summarization_model;
```

It may take a while to register as complete depending on the internet connection. Once the creation is complete, the behavior is the same as with any other AI table – you can query it either by specifying synthetic data in the actual query:

```sql
SELECT article, highlights
FROM text_summarization_model
WHERE article = "Apple's Watch hits stores this Friday when customers and employees
                alike will be able to pre-order the timepiece. And boss Tim Cook is
                rewarding his staff by offering them a 50 per cent discount on the device.";
```

Here is the output data:

```sql
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| article                                                                                                                                                                                                            | highlights                                                                         |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Apple's Watch hits stores this Friday when customers and employees alike will be able to pre-order the timepiece. And boss Tim Cook is rewarding his staff by offering them a 50 per cent discount on the device.  | Apple's Watch hits stores this Friday, and employees will be able to pre-order the |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Or by joining with another table for batch predictions:

```sql
SELECT input.article, output.highlights
FROM mysql_demo_db.articles AS input
JOIN text_summarization_model AS output
LIMIT 3;
```

Here is the output data:

```sql
+----------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| article                                                        | highlights                                                                                     |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Video footage has emerged of a law enforcement officer…        | A video has emerged of a law enforcement officer grabbing a cell phone from a woman who was    |
| A new restaurant is offering a five-course drink-paired menu…  | A new restaurant in London is offering a five-course drink-paired menu for dogs                |
| Mother-of-two Anna Tilley survived after spending four days…   | Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The `articles` table is used to make batch predictions. Upon joining the `text_summarization_model` model with the `articles` table, the model uses all values from the `article` column.

## Leverage the NLP Capabilities with MindsDB

By integrating databases and OpenAI using MindsDB, developers can easily extract insights from text data with just a few SQL commands. These powerful natural language processing (NLP) models are capable of answering questions with or without context and completing general prompts.

Furthermore, these models are powered by large pre-trained language models from OpenAI, so there is no need for manual development work. Ultimately, this provides developers with an easy way to incorporate powerful NLP capabilities into their applications while saving time and resources compared to traditional ML development pipelines and methods. All in all, MindsDB makes it possible for developers to harness the power of OpenAI efficiently!

MindsDB is now the fastest-growing open-source applied machine-learning platform in the world. Its community continues to contribute to more than 70 data-source and ML-framework integrations. Stay tuned for the upcoming features - including more control over the interface parameters and fine-tuning models directly from MindsDB!
