MindsDB is an AI Automation platform for building AI/ML powered features and applications. It works by connecting any source of data with any AI/ML model or framework and automating how real-time data flows between them.

MindsDB allows you to easily:

 - Connect to any store of data or end-user application.
 - Pass data to an AI model from any store of data or end-user application.
 - Plug the output of an AI model into any store of data or end-user application.
 - Fully automate these workflows to build AI-powered features and applications.

## Build with MindsDB

As you can connect any data source with any AI/ML model, you can build and automate any AI/ML use case.

Here are some AI/LLM use cases:
      - [Semantic Search and Q&A/RAG](/nlp/question-answering-inside-mysql-with-openai)
      - [Chatbots](/sql/tutorials/twitterbot-mariadb-enterprise-server-skysql)
      - [Classification](/nlp/nlp-extended-examples#text-classification)
      - [Sentiment Analysis](/nlp/sentiment-analysis-inside-mysql-with-openai)
      - [Summarisation](/nlp/text-summarization-inside-mysql-with-openai)
      - [Translation](/nlp/nlp-extended-examples#translation)

You can use MindsDB for the following machine learning use cases:
      - [Forecasting](/sql/tutorials/eeg-forecasting)
      - [Classification](/sql/tutorials/customer-churn)
      - [Regression](/sql/tutorials/home-rentals)
      - Anomaly Detection
      - Recommenders

You can use one of MindsDB’s AutoMLs or you can bring your own, pre-trained model.

MindsDB empowers you to create custom AI workflows by selecting from its wide range of integrations with data sources and AI/ML frameworks. For instance, envision an AI workflow featuring integrations with Binance, TimeGPT, and Slack. In this scenario, you can seamlessly retrieve real-time trading data from Binance, utilize it as input for a TimeGPT model to generate forecasts, and receive these forecasts as Slack notifications.

Here is a typical AI workflow that can be automated with Jobs:
      - Get data from a data source connected to MindsDB.
      - Optionally, retrain or finetune an AI model with new data.
      - Process data using one or more AI models.
      - Send output, predictions or forecasts, to a data source connected to MindsDB.

## Benefits of MindsDB

1. Unified AI Deployment and Management
    MindsDB integrates directly with the database, warehouse, or stream. This eliminates the need to build and maintain custom, complex data pipelines or separate systems for AI/ML deployment.

2. Automated AI Workflows
    MindsDB automates the entire AI workflow to execute on time-based or event-based triggers. No need to build custom automation logic to get predictions, move data, or (re)train models.

3. Turn every developer into an AI Engineer
    MindsDB enables developers to leverage their existing SQL skills, accelerating the adoption of AI across teams and departments, turning every developer into an AI Engineer.

4. Enhanced Scalability and Performance
    Whether in your private cloud or using MindsDB’s managed service, MindsDB enables you to handle large-scale AI/ML workloads efficiently. MindsDB can scale to meet the demands of your use case, ensuring optimal performance and responsiveness.
