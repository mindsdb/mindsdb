title: "What is MindsDB?"
---

Data that lives in your database is a valuable asset. MindsDB enables you to use
your data and make forecasts. It speeds up the ML development process by
bringing machine learning into the database.

With MindsDB, you can build, train, optimize, and deploy your ML models without
the need for other platforms. And to get the forecasts, simply query your data
and ML models. Read along to see some examples.

## What are AI Tables?

MindsDB brings machine learning into databases by employing the concept of AI
Tables.

AI Tables are machine learning models stored as virtual tables inside a
database. They facilitate making predictions based on your data. You can perform
the time series, regression, and classification predictions within your database
and get the output almost instantly by querying an AI Table with simple SQL
statements.

## Deep Dive into the AI Tables

### Current Challenges

Let’s consider the following `income_table` table that stores the `income` and
`debt` values.

```sql
SELECT income, debt
FROM income_table;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+------+-----+
|income|debt |
+------+-----+
|60000 |20000|
|80000 |25100|
|100000|30040|
|120000|36010|
+------+-----+
```

A simple visualization of the data present in the `income_table` table is as
follows:

![Income vs Debt](/assets/sql/income_vs_debt.png)

Querying the income table to get the `debt` value for a particular `income`
value results in the following:

```sql
SELECT income, debt
FROM income_table
WHERE income = 80000;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+------+-----+
|income|debt |
+------+-----+
|80000 |25100|
+------+-----+
```

And here is what we get:

![Income vs Debt chart](/assets/sql/income_vs_debt_known_value.png)

But what happens when querying the table for an `income` value that is not
present there?

```sql
SELECT income, debt
FROM income_table
WHERE income = 90000;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

When the `WHERE` clause condition is not fulfilled for any of the rows, no
value is returned.

When a table doesn’t have an exact match, the query returns an empty set or null
value. This is where the AI Tables come into play!

### Solution Offered by MindsDB

Let’s create a `debt_model` model that allows us to approximate the `debt` value
for any `income` value. We train the `debt_model` model using the data from the
`income_table` table.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.debt_model
FROM income_table
PREDICT debt;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (x.xxx sec)
```

MindsDB provides the [`CREATE MODEL`](/sql/create/predictor/)
statement. On execution of this statement, the predictive model works in the
background, automatically creating a vector representation of the data that can
be visualized as follows:

![Income vs Debt model](/assets/sql/income_vs_debt_predictor.png)

Let’s now look for the `debt` value of some random `income` value. To get the
approximated `debt` value, we query the `mindsdb.debt_model` model instead
of the `income_table` table.

```sql
SELECT income, debt
FROM mindsdb.debt_model
WHERE income = 90000;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+------+-----+
|income|debt |
+------+-----+
|90000 |27820|
+------+-----+
```

And here is how it looks:

## Why Choose MindsDB?

### Shift to Data Analysis Paradigm

There is an ongoing transformational shift within the modern business world from
the “what happened and why” based on historical data analysis to the “what will
happen and how can we make it happen” based on machine learning predictive
modeling.

![Analytics](/assets/sql/analytics_shift.png)

The success of your predictions depends both on the data you have available and
the models trained with the data. Data Scientists and Data Engineers require
efficient and easy-to-use tools to prepare the data for feature engineering,
then training the models, and finally, deploying, monitoring, and managing these
implementations for optimal prediction confidence.

### The Machine Learning Lifecycle

The ML lifecycle is a process that consists of the data preparation phase,
modeling phase, and deployment phase. The diagram below presents all the steps
included in each of the stages.

![ML Workflow](/assets/sql/machine_learning_lifecycle.png)

Current solutions for implementing machine learning encounter various
challenges, such as time-consuming preparation, cleaning, and labeling of
substantial amouts of data, and difficulties in finding qualified ML/AI data
scientists.

The processes that must be followed by the ML/AI data scientists to implement
machine learning include the following:

- feature engineering,
- building, training, and optimizing models,
- assembling, verifying, and deploying models to production,
- continuously monitoring and improving the models,
- continuously training the models, as they require multiple training iterations
  with existing data,
- extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from one system to another,
  which is complicated and may lead to multiple copies of information.

A recent study has shown it takes 64% of companies a month up to over a year to
deploy a machine learning model into production. Leveraging existing databases
and automating all the aforementioned processes is called AutoML. AutoML has
been gaining traction within enterprises for enabling non-experts to use machine
learning models for practical applications.

## Why MindsDB?

Well, as with most names, we needed one. We like science fiction and
[The Culture](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture_(series)>) series,
where the AI super-smart entities are called _Minds_. So that's for the first
part of our name.

As for the second part - the _DB_, it is quite self-explanatory. Although we
will support all kinds of data in the future, but currently, our objective is to
add intelligence to existing data stores and databases. Hence, the term _DB_
comes along.

So there we have it, MindsDB.

And why the bear? We wanted to honor the open-source tradition of animals
related to projects. We went for a bear because MindsDB was born at UC Berkeley,
where the first codes were written. Then, we went a step further and decided for
a polar bear.
