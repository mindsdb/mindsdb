# Why I Tried MindsDB as a Beginner Exploring AI Without Python

Hey MindsDB Team 👋

My name is Aryan, and I’m a student curious about AI — but I don’t know Python or machine learning.

I wanted to try an ML tool that doesn’t require setting up notebooks or learning Pandas. That’s when I found MindsDB.

Here’s what I did, step-by-step:

---

## 🧪 What I Tried (No Code)

✅ I signed up at [cloud.mindsdb.com](https://cloud.mindsdb.com)  
✅ I uploaded a CSV of product sales  
✅ I typed:  
> “Predict next month’s sales based on price and category”  
✅ Got predictions in seconds — no model building, no ML jargon

---

## 🎯 What Helped Me Most

- Chat interface was easy for a beginner  
- The natural language queries felt like Google Assistant  
- UI helped me explore predictions without writing code

---

## 💡 Feedback / Suggestions

- A guided tour popup would help first-time users a lot  
- More beginner templates: e.g., “predict sales” or “forecast website traffic”

## 🎁 Why I’m Contributing

I’m contributing this short file to share my real experience — not as a developer, but as a curious learner. I hope it encourages other non-tech users to try MindsDB.

Thanks for building something this friendly! 🙏
