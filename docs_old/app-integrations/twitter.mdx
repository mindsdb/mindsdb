In this section, we present how to integrate a Twitter account with MindsDB.

## Connection

To connect a Twitter account to MindsDB, you need a Twitter developer account.

<Tip>
We recommend you use the [Elevated access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/support/twitter-api/developer-account) allowing you to pull 2m tweets and to avoid _parameters or authentication issue_ error you might get sometimes. You can check [this step-by-step guide](https://medium.com/@skillcate/set-up-twitter-api-to-pull-2m-tweets-month-44d004c6f7ce) describing how to apply for the Elevated access.
</Tip>

If you don't already have a Twitter developer account, follow the steps in the video below to apply for one.

  When presented with questions under *How will you use the Twitter API or Twitter Data?*, use answers similar to the ones below (tweak to fit your exact use case). The more thorough your answers are, the more likely it is your account will get approved.

  **Intended Usage (In Your Words)**

  *I have a blog and want to educate users how to use the Twitter API with MindsDB.*

  *I will read tweets that mention me and use them with MindsDB machine learning to generate responses. I plan to post tweets 2-3 times a day and keep using Twitter like I normally would.*

  **Are you planning to analyze Twitter data?**

  *I plan to build machine learning algorithms based on Twitter data. I am interested in doing sentiment analysis and topic analysis.*

  *I will potentially extract:*
  * *Tweet text*
  * *Favorite count and retweet count*
  * *Hashtags and mentions*

  **Will your app use Tweet, Retweet, Like, Follow, or Direct Message functionality?**

  *I will use the Twitter API to post responses to tweets that mention me.*

  *I will have word filters to make sure that I never share offensive or potentially controversial subjects.*

  **Do you plan to display Tweets or aggregate data about Twitter content outside Twitter?**

  *I plan to share aggregate data as examples for users of my upcoming blog. I don't intend to create an automated dashboard that consumes a lot of Twitter API calls.*

  *Every API call will be done locally, or automated on a simple web server. Aggregate of data will be for educational purposes only.*

  **Will your product, service, or analysis make Twitter content or derived information available to a government entity?**

  Answer NO to this one.
</Accordion>

If you already have a Twitter developer account, you need to generate API keys following the instructions below or heading to the [Twitter developer website](https://developer.twitter.com/en).

<Accordion title="How to Generate API Keys" icon="twitter" iconType="thin">
  * Create an application with Read/Write permissions activated:
    * Open [developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps).
    * Select the `Add app` button to create a new app.
    * Select the `Create new` button.
    * Select `Production` and give it a name.
    * Copy and populate the following in the below `CREATE DATABASE` statement:
      * `Bearer Token` as a value of the `bearer_token` parameter.
      * `API Key` as a value of the `consumer_key` parameter.
      * `API Key Secret` as a value of the `consumer_secret` parameter.
  * Setup user authentication settings:
    * Click `Setup` under `User authentication settings`:
    * On `Permissions`, select `Read and Write`.
    * On `Type of app`, select `Web App`, `Automated App or Bot`.
    * On `App info`, provide any URL for the callback URL and website URL (you can use the URL of this page).
    * Click `Save`.
  * Generate access tokens:
    * Once you are back in the app settings, click `Keys and Tokens`:
    * Generate `Access Token` and `Access Token Secret` and populate it in the below `CREATE DATABASE` statement:
      * `Access Token` as a value of the `access_token` parameter.
      * `Access Token Secret` as a value of the `access_token_secret` parameter.
</Accordion>

Once you have all the tokens and keys, here is how to connect your Twitter account to MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_twitter 
WITH 
    ENGINE = 'twitter',
    PARAMETERS = {
      "bearer_token": "twitter bearer token",
      "consumer_key": "twitter consumer key",
      "consumer_secret": "twitter consumer key secret",
      "access_token": "twitter access token",
	  "access_token_secret": "twitter access token secret"
    };
```

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/twitter_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

The `my_twitter` database contains a table called `tweets` by default.

Here is how to search tweets containing `mindsdb` keyword:

```sql
SELECT id, created_at, author_username, text 
FROM my_twitter.tweets 
WHERE query = '(mindsdb OR #mindsdb) -is:retweet -is:reply'
AND created_at > '2023-02-16' 
LIMIT 20;
```

<Warning>
Please note that we can see only recent tweets from the past seven days. The `created_at` column condition is skipped if the provided date is earlier than seven days.
</Warning>

Alternatively, you can use a Twitter native query, as below:

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_twitter (
  search_recent_tweets(
    query = '(mindsdb OR #mindsdb) -is:retweet -is:reply',
    start_time = '2023-03-16T00:00:00.000Z',
    max_results = 2
  )
);
```

<Tip>
To learn more about native queries in MindsDB, visit our docs [here](/sql/native-queries).
</Tip>

Here is how to write tweets:

```sql
INSERT INTO my_twitter.tweets (reply_to_tweet_id, text)
VALUES 
    (1626198053446369280, 'MindsDB is great! now its super simple to build ML powered apps'),
    (1626198053446369280, 'Holy!! MindsDB is the best thing they have invented for developers doing ML');
```
