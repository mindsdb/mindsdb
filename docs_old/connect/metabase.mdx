Metabase is open-source software that facilitates data analysis. It lets you visualize your data easily and intuitively. Now that MindsDB supports the MySQL binary protocol, you can connect it to Metabase and see the forecasts by creating and training the models.

For more information, visit [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/).

## Setup

### MindsDB

Let's set up the MindsDB following one of the guides from the **Deployment**
section. Please note that the MindsDB Cloud is not yet supported.

<Warning>
  **Currently, only local and on-premise installations are stable**
</Warning>

You can choose one of the following approaches to set up the MindsDB locally:

- [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker)
- [Windows via pip](/setup/self-hosted/pip/windows)
- [Linux via pip](/setup/self-hosted/pip/linux)
- [MacOS via pip](/setup/self-hosted/pip/macos)
- [Sourcecode via pip](/setup/self-hosted/pip/source)

Here, we use the [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) setup for MindsDB.

### Metabase

Now, let's set up the Metabase by following one of the approaches presented on
[the Metabase Open Source Edition page](https://www.metabase.com/start/oss/).

Here, we use the
[.jar approach](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/installation-and-operation/running-the-metabase-jar-file.html)
for Metabase.

## How to Connect

Follow the steps below to connect your MindsDB to Metabase.

1. Open your Metabase and navigate to the _Admin settings_ by clicking the cog
   in the bottom left corner.
2. Once there, click on _Databases_ in the top navigation bar.
3. Click on _Add database_ in the top right corner.
4. Fill in the form using the following data:

  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Local MindsDB">
      ```text
      Database type: `MySQL`
      Display name: `MindsDB`
      Host: `localhost`
      Port: `47335`
      Database name: `mindsdb`
      Username: `mindsdb`
      Password: *leave it empty*
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="MindsDB Cloud">
      ```text
      Database type: `MySQL`
      Display name: `MindsDB`
      Host: `cloud.mindsdb.com`
      Port: `3306`
      Database name: `mindsdb`
      Username: `<your MindsDB Cloud username>`
      Password: `<your MindsDB Cloud password>`
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="MindsDB Pro">
      ```text
      Database type: `MySQL`
      Display name: `MindsDB`
      Host: `<dedicated instace ip>`
      Port: 3306
      Database name: `mindsdb`
      Username: `<your MindsDB Cloud username>`
      Password: `<your MindsDB Cloud password>`
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

## Example

Now that the connection between MindsDB and Metabase is established, let's do
some examples.

Most of the SQL statements that you usually run in your
[MindsDB SQL Editor](/connect/mindsdb_editor/) can be run in Metabase as well.
Let's start with something easy.

On your Metabase's home page, click on _New > SQL query_ in the top right corner
and then, select your MindsDB database.

Let's execute the following command in the editor.

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

On execution, we get:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/metabase_run_query_show_tables.png" />
</p>

Please note that creating a
[database connection](/sql/tutorials/home-rentals/#connecting-the-data) using
the `CREATE DATABASE` statement fails because of the curly braces (`{}`) being
used by JDBC as the escape sequences.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE example_db
    WITH ENGINE = "postgres",
    PARAMETERS = {
        "user": "demo_user",
        "password": "demo_password",
        "host": "3.220.66.106",
        "port": "5432",
        "database": "demo"
};
```

On execution, we get:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/metabase_run_query_failure.png" />
</p>

You can overcome this issue using the
[MindsDB SQL Editor](/connect/mindsdb_editor/) to create a database.

Now, getting back to the Metabase, let's run some queries on the database
created with the help of the [MindsDB SQL Editor](/connect/mindsdb_editor/).

```sql
SELECT *
FROM example_db.demo_data.home_rentals
LIMIT 10;
```

On execution, we get:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/metabase_run_query_home_rentals.png" />
</p>

## What's Next?

Now that you are all set, we recommend you check out our **Tutorials** and
**Community Tutorials** sections, where you'll find various examples of
regression, classification, and time series predictions with MindsDB.

To learn more about MindsDB itself, follow the guide on
[MindsDB database structure](/sql/table-structure/). Also, don't miss out on the
remaining pages from the **SQL API** section, as they explain a common SQL
syntax with examples.

Have fun!
