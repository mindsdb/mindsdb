This section gets you started on how to contribute to the MindsDB documentation.

MindsDB's documentation is run using Mintlify. If you want to contribute to our docs, please follow the steps below to set up the environment locally.

## Running the Docs Locally

<Info>
    **Prerequisite**
    You should have installed Git (version 2.30.1 or higher) and Node.js (version 18.10.0 or higher).
</Info>

Step 1. Clone the MindsDB Git repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb.git
```

Step 2. Install Mintlify on your OS:

```console
npm i mintlify -g
```

Step 3. Go to the `docs` folder inside the cloned MindsDB Git repository and start Mintlify there:

<Warning>
  **Getting an Error?**
  If you use the Windows operating system, you may get an error saying `no such file or directory: C:/Users/Username/.mintlify/mint/client`. Here are the steps to troubleshoot it:
        - Go to the `C:/Users/Username/.mintlify/` directory.
        - Remove the `mint` folder.
        - Open the Git Bash in this location and run `git clone https://github.com/mintlify/mint.git`.
        - Repeat step 3.
