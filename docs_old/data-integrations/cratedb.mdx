This is the implementation of the CrateDB data handler for MindsDB.

[CrateDB](https://crate.io/) is a distributed SQL database management system that integrates a fully searchable document-oriented data store. It is open-source, written in Java, based on a shared-nothing architecture, and designed for high scalability. CrateDB includes components from Lucene, Elasticsearch and Netty.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using `crate`, a Python library that allows you to use Python code to run SQL commands on CrateDB.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `user` is the username associated with the database.
* `password` is the password to authenticate your access.
* `host` is the hostname or IP adress of the server.
* `port` is the port through which connection is to be made.
* `schema_name` is schema name to get tables from. Defaults to `doc`.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/crate_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the CrateDB database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE crate_datasource
WITH
    engine = 'crate',
    parameters = {
        "user": "crate",
        "password": "",
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 4200,
        "schema_name": "doc"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM crate_datasource.demo;
```
