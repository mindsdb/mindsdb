This is the implementation of the TDEngine data handler for MindsDB.

[TDengine](https://tdengine.com/) is an open source, high-performance, cloud native time-series database optimized for Internet of Things (IoT), Connected Cars, and Industrial IoT. It enables efficient, real-time data ingestion, processing, and monitoring of TB and even PB scale data per day, generated by billions of sensors and data collectors. TDengine differentiates itself from other time-series databases with numerous advantages, such as high performance, simplified solution, cloud-native, ease of use, easy data analytics, and open-source.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using `taos/taosrest`, a Python library that allows you to use Python code to run SQL commands on the TDEngine server.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `user` is the username associated with the server.
* `password` is the password to authenticate your access.
* `url` is the URL to the TDEngine server. For local server, the URL is `localhost:6041` by default.
* `token` is the unique token provided while using TDEngine Cloud.
* `database` is the database name to be connected.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/tdengine_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the TDEngine database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE tdengine_datasource
WITH
    ENGINE = 'tdengine',
    PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "tdengine_user",
    "password": "password",
    "url": "localhost:6041",
    "token": "token",
    "database": "tdengine_db"
    };
```

<Note>
You can specify `token` instead of `user` and `password` while using TDEngine.
</Note>

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM tdengine_datasource.demo_table;
```
