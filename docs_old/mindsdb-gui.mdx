MindsDB offers a user-friendly graphical interface that allows users to execute SQL commands, view their outputs, and easily navigate connected data sources, projects, and their contents.

Let's explore the features and usage of the MindsDB editor.

## Accessing the MindsDB GUI Editor

One way to access the MindsDB editor is to create a [MindsDB Cloud account](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/). This option doesn't require any installation. Simply, by logging in to your MindsDB Cloud account, you can access all features of the editor.

Alternatively, you can install MindsDB locally via pip or Docker, following the instructions available under the **Self-Hosted** subsection of the **Deployment Options** section. If you choose this options, you can access the editor via `127.0.0.1:47334` in your browser.

## Exploring the MindsDB GUI Editor

### Query Editor

This is the primary component where users can input SQL commands and queries. It provides a code editor environment where users can write, edit, and execute SQL statements.

It is located in the top center of the MindsDB GUI.

You can open multiple query editor tabs by clicking the plus button next to the current tab, like this:

</p>

### Results Viewer

Once a query is executed, the results viewer displays the output of the query. It presents the results in a tabular format, showing rows and columns of data.

It is located in the bottom center of the MindsDB GUI.

MindsDB supports additional features such as the following:

1. The [Data Insights](/sql/data-insights) feature provides useful data visualization charts.
2. The Export feature lets you export the query output as a CSV or Markdown file.

### Object Explorer

The object explorer provides an overview of the projects, models, views, connected data sources, and tables.

Users can navigate through the available objects by expanding the tree structure items. Upon hovering over the tables, you can query their content using the provided `SELECT` statement, as below.

### Model Progress Bar

MindsDB provides a custom SQL statement to create and deploy models as virtual tables. Upon executing the [`CREATE MODEL`](/sql/create/model) statement, you can monitor the training progress at the bottom-left corner below the object explorer.
