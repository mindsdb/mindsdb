## Introduction

In this blog post, we present how to create OpenAI models within MindsDB. In this example, we ask a question to a model and get an answer. The input data is taken from our sample MySQL database.

## Prerequisites

To follow along, you can sign up for an account at [cloud.mindsdb.com](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/register/nlp). Alternatively, head to [MindsDB documentation](https://docs.mindsdb.com/) and follow the instructions to manually set up a local instance of MindsDB via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [pip](/setup/self-hosted/pip/source).

## Tutorial

In this tutorial, we create a predictive model to answer questions in a specified domain.

We use a table from our MySQL public demo database, so let's start by connecting MindsDB to it:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mysql_demo_db
WITH ENGINE = 'mysql',
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "user",
    "password": "MindsDBUser123!",
    "host": "db-demo-data.cwoyhfn6bzs0.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
    "port": "3306",
    "database": "public"
};
```

Now that we've connected our database to MindsDB, let's query the data to be used in the example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mysql_demo_db.questions
LIMIT 3;
```

Here is the output:

```sql
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+-------------+
| article_title    | question                                               | true_answer |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+-------------+
| Alessandro_Volta | Was Volta an Italian physicist?                        | yes         |
| Alessandro_Volta | Is Volta buried in the city of Pittsburgh?             | no          |
| Alessandro_Volta | Did Volta have a passion for the study of electricity? | yes         |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+-------------+
```

Let's create a model table to answer all questions from the input dataset:

```sql
CREATE MODEL question_answering_model
PREDICT answer
USING
    engine = 'openai',
    prompt_template = 'answer the question of text:{{question}} about text:{{article_title}}';
```

<Info>
**Default Model**

When you create an OpenAI model in MindsDB, it uses the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model by default. But you can use the `gpt-4` model as well by passing it to the `model-name` parameter in the `USING` clause of the `CREATE MODEL` statement.

</Info>

In practice, the `CREATE MODEL` statement triggers MindsDB to generate an AI table called `question_answering_model` that uses the OpenAI integration to predict a column named `answer`. The model lives inside the default `mindsdb` project. In MindsDB, projects are a natural way to keep artifacts, such as models or views, separate according to what predictive task they solve. You can learn more about MindsDB projects [here](/sql/project).

The `USING` clause specifies the parameters that this handler requires.

- The `engine` parameter defines that we use the `openai` engine.
- The `prompt_template` parameter conveys the structure of a message that is to be completed with additional text generated by the model.

  If you're using a local deployment, in order to use the OpenAI integration,
  you need to install the `openai` Python package. You can do this by running
  the following command: ```bash pip install openai ```
</Warning>

<Warning title = "Using OpenAI Locally or On-Premises" icon = "triangle-exclamation" color="#fcd34dcc" >

We use the OpenAI engine to create a model in MindsDB. Please note that the `api_key` parameter is optional on [cloud.mindsdb.com](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/register/nlp) but mandatory for local usage/on-premise. You can obtain an OpenAI API key by signing up for OpenAI's API services on their website. Once you have signed up, you can find your API key in the _API Key_ section of the OpenAI dashboard. You can then pass this API key to the MindsDB platform when creating models.

To create a `question_answering_model` model in MindsDB, you can run the following code:

```sql
CREATE MODEL question_answering_model
PREDICT answer
USING
    engine = 'openai',
    prompt_template = 'answer the question of text:{{question}} about text:{{article_title}}',
    api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'; -- MANDATORY FOR LOCAL MODE
```

Alternatively, you can create a MindsDB ML engine that includes the API key, so you don't have to enter it each time:

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE openai2
FROM openai
USING
  api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY';
```

Please note that it is required to provide an OpenAI API key when using MindsDB Pro version.

</Warning>

<Note>
If you want to use the OpenAI API key provided by MindsDB, please confirm your email. Alternatively, you have the option to utilize your own OpenAI API key by specifying it in the `api_key` parameter.
</Note>

Once the `CREATE MODEL` statement has started execution, we can check the status of the creation process with the following query:

```sql
DESCRIBE question_answering_model;
```

It may take a while to register as complete depending on the internet connection. Once the creation is complete, the behavior is the same as with any other AI table – you can query it either by specifying synthetic data in the actual query:

```sql
SELECT article_title, question, answer
FROM question_answering_model
WHERE question = 'Was Abraham Lincoln the sixteenth President of the United States?'
AND article_title = 'Abraham_Lincoln';
```

Here is the output data:

```sql
+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| article_title    | question                                                          | answer                                                                 |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Abraham_Lincoln  | Was Abraham Lincoln the sixteenth President of the United States? | Yes, Abraham Lincoln was the sixteenth President of the United States. |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Or by joining with another table for batch predictions:

```sql
SELECT input.article_title, input.question, output.answer
FROM mysql_demo_db.questions AS input
JOIN question_answering_model AS output
LIMIT 3;
```

Here is the output data:

```sql
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| article_title    | question                                               | answer                                                 |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Alessandro_Volta | Was Volta an Italian physicist?                        | Yes, Volta was an Italian physicist.                   |
| Alessandro_Volta | Is Volta buried in the city of Pittsburgh?             | No, Volta is not buried in the city of Pittsburgh.     |
| Alessandro_Volta | Did Volta have a passion for the study of electricity? | Yes, Volta had a passion for the study of electricity. |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
```

The `questions` table is used to make batch predictions. Upon joining the `question_answering_model` model with the `questions` table, the model uses all values from the `article_title` and `question` columns.
