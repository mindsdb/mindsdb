Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that
enables computers to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language.

Some of the most popular applications of NLP include:

- chatbots,
- sentiment analysis,
- text summarization,
- machine translation,
- question answering,
- text classification,
- named entity recognition,
- topic modeling,
- and more.

In businesses and applications, NLP is a powerful tool used to utilize the potential of data. It can help to:

- extract insights from unstructured data,
- automate processes,
- improve customer service,
- and more.

MindsDB provides a powerful NLP engine that can use pre-trained NLP models to extract insights from text-based data
without the need for a vast amount of experience or in-depth knowledge of linguistics and data science.

MindsDB's NLP engine for pre-trained models is powered by [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), a leading open-source NLP library that provides a wide range
of pre-trained NLP models that can be used to extract insights from your text-based data and [OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4 models](https://openai.com/), OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4 models
are a powerful set of pre-trained NLP models, It has the record of being the largest neural network ever built with 175 billion parameters.

<Tip>
Currently, MindsDB's NLP engine is powered by [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). But we plan to expand to other NLP options in the future, so stay tuned!
