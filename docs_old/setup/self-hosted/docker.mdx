## Install Docker

If you haven't done that already, install Docker on your machine following [the instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install). To make sure Docker is successfully installed on your machine, run a test container as follows:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

You should see the `Hello from Docker!` message. Otherwise, check the
[Docker's Get Started](https://www.docker.com/get-started) documentation.

<Warning>
**Docker for Mac users - RAM allocation issues**

By default, Docker for Mac allocates 2 GB of RAM, which is insufficient for
deploying MindsDB with Docker. We recommend increasing the default RAM limit to
8 GB. Please refer to the
[Docker Desktop for Mac users manual](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/#resources)
for more information on how to increase the allocated memory.
</Warning>

## Install & Start MindsDB

<Tip>
Please note that this method of MindsDB installation requires a minimum of 8 GB RAM and 20 GB free storage.
</Tip>

Run the command below to start MindsDB in Docker.

```bash
docker run -p 47334:47334 -p 47335:47335 mindsdb/mindsdb
```

If you wish to simply spin up the container without the logs, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 47334:47334 -p 47335:47335 mindsdb/mindsdb
```

<Info>
What's the difference?

-   On running the previous command, docker will print out all the mindsdb logs in your shell.
-   Using Docker's `detach` flag, the CLI will simply return the container ID, such that you can use the same shell again for different things.
</Info>

<Tip>
If you would like to persist your models & configurations in the host machine, run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir mdb_data
docker run -p 47334:47334 -p 47335:47335 -v $(pwd)/mdb_data:/root/mdb_storage mindsdb/mindsdb
```

Let's analyze this command part by part:

-   `docker run` is a native Docker command used to start a container
-   `-p 47334:47334` publishes port 47334 to access MindsDB GUI and HTTP API
-   `-p 47335:47335` publishes port 47335 to access MindsDB MySQL API
-   `-v $(pwd)/mdb_data:/root/mdb_storage` maps the newly created folder `mdb_data` on the host machine to the `/root/mdb_storage` inside the container
-   `mindsdb/mindsdb` is the container we want to start
</Tip>

Now you can access the MindsDB editor by going to `127.0.0.1:47334` in your browser.

## Configuration Options

### Default Configuration

The default configuration for MindsDB's Docker image is stored as a JSON code, as below.

```json
{
    "config_version": "1.4",
    "storage_dir": "/root/mdb_storage",
    "log": {
        "level": {
            "console": "ERROR",
            "file": "WARNING",
            "db": "WARNING"
        }
    },
    "debug": false,
    "integrations": {},
    "auth": {
        "username": "mindsdb",
        "password": "123"
    },
    "api": {
        "http": {
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": "47334"
        },
        "mysql": {
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": "47335",
            "database": "mindsdb",
            "ssl": true
        },
        "mongodb": {
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": "47336",
            "database": "mindsdb"
        }
    }
}
```

### Custom Configuration

To override the default configuration, you can provide values via the `MDB_CONFIG_CONTENT` environment variable, as below.

```bash
docker run -e MDB_CONFIG_CONTENT='{"api":{"http": {"host": "0.0.0.0","port": "8080"}}}' mindsdb/mindsdb
```

## Known Issues

### #1

If you experience any issues related to MKL or your training process does not complete, please add the `MKL_SERVICE_FORCE_INTEL` environment variable, as below.

```bash
docker run -e MKL_SERVICE_FORCE_INTEL=1 -p 47334:47334 -p 47335:47335 mindsdb/mindsdb
```

## What's Next

Now that you installed and started MindsDB locally in your Docker container, go ahead and find out how to create and train a model using the [`CREATE MODEL`](/sql/create/model) statement. In the **MindsDB SQL** section, you'll find a comprehensive overview of the SQL syntax offered by MindsDB. We also provide Mongo-QL syntax documented in the **MindsDB Mongo-QL** section.

You can connect MindsDB to different clients, including [PostgreSQL CLI](/connect/postgres-client) and [MySQL CLI](/connect/mysql-client).

Check out the **Use Cases** section to follow tutorials that cover Large Language Models, Natural Language Processing, Time Series, Classification, and Regression models.
