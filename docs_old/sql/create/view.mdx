## Description

The `CREATE VIEW` statement creates a view, which is a great way to do data preparation in MindsDB. A VIEW is a saved `SELECT` statement, which is executed every time we call this view.

## Syntax

Here is the syntax:

```sql
CREATE VIEW project_name.view_name AS (
    SELECT a.column_name, ...,
           p.model_column AS model_column
    FROM integration_name.table_name AS a
    JOIN mindsdb.predictor_name AS p
);
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (x.xxx sec)
```

Where:

| Name                                  | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project_name`                        | Name of the project to store the view.                                                   |
| `view_name`                           | Name of the view.                                                                        |
| `a.column_name, ...`                  | Columns of the data source table that are the input for the model to make predictions.   |
| `p.model_column`                      | Name of the target column to be predicted.                                               |
| `integration_name.table_name`         | Data source table name along with the integration where it resides.                      |
| `predictor_name`                      | Name of the model.                                                                       |

## Example

Below is the query that creates and trains the `home_rentals_model` model to predict the `rental_price` value. The inner `SELECT` statement provides all real estate listing data used to train the model.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.home_rentals_model
FROM integration
    (SELECT * FROM house_rentals_data)
PREDICT rental_price;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (x.xxx sec)
```

Now, we can [`JOIN`](/sql/api/join/) the `home_rentals_data` table with the `home_rentals_model` model to make predictions. By creating a view (using the `CREATE VIEW` statement) that is based on the `SELECT` statement joining the data and model tables, we create an AI Table.

Here, the `SELECT` statement joins the data source table and the model table. The input data for making predictions consists of the `sqft`, `number_of_bathrooms`, and `location` columns. These are joined with the `rental_price` column that stores predicted values.

```sql
CREATE VIEW mindsdb.home_rentals_predictions AS (
    SELECT
        a.sqft,
        a.number_of_bathrooms,
        a.location,
        p.rental_price AS price
    FROM integration.home_rentals_data AS a
    JOIN mindsdb.home_rentals_model AS p
);
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (x.xxx sec)
```

<Note>
    **Dataset for Training and Dataset for Joining**

    In this example, we used the same dataset (`integration.home_rentals_data`) for training the model (see the `CREATE MODEL` statement above) and for joining with the model to make predictions (see the `CREATE VIEW` statement above). It doesn't happen like that in real-world scenarios.
    Normally, you use the old data to train the model, and then you join the new data with this model to make predictions.

    Consider the `old_data` dataset that stores data from the years 2019-2021 and the `new_data` dataset that stores data from the year 2022.

    We train the model with the `old_data` dataset like this:

    ```sql
    CREATE MODEL mindsdb.data_model
    FROM integration
        (SELECT * FROM old_data)
    PREDICT column;
    ```

    Now, having the `data_model` model trained using the `old_data` dataset, we can join this model with the `new_data` dataset to make predictions like this:

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW mindsdb.data_predictions AS (
        SELECT
            a.column1,
            a.column2,
            a.column3,
            p.column AS predicted_column
        FROM integration.new_data AS a
        JOIN mindsdb.data_model AS p
    );
    ```
</Note>

## USING VIEW

Examples to use view

1. Complex select on view (it is grouping in this example).

```sql
SELECT type, last(bedrooms) 
FROM mindsdb.house_v
GROUP BY 1
```

2. Creating predictor from view

```sql
CREATE MODEL house_sales_model
FROM mindsdb (
  SELECT * FROM house_v
) PREDICT ma
ORDER BY saledate
GROUP BY bedrooms, type
WINDOW 1 HORIZON 4
```

3. Using predictor with view

```sql
SELECT * FROM mindsdb.house_v
JOIN mindsdb.house_sales_model
WHERE house_v.saledate > latest 
```
