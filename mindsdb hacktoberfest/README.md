## üéØ Goals
- Showcase zero-ETL, data-in-place AI analytics with MindsDB KBs.
- Demonstrate hybrid semantic + SQL logic and use Evaluate KB for quality.
- Encourage integrations (Salesforce, BigQuery, Confluence, Gong, Postgres, etc.).
- Create repeatable app templates for use cases in accordance to our industries listed on our webpage, i.e [Finance Services](https://mindsdb.com/solutions/industry/ai-data-solution-financial-services), [Energy & Utilities](https://mindsdb.com/solutions/industry/ai-data-solution-energy-utilities), [Retail & E-commerce](https://mindsdb.com/solutions/industry/ai-data-solution-retail-ecommerce), [Enterprise Software Vendors](https://mindsdb.com/solutions/industry/ai-data-solution-b2b-tech), or for another Enterprise industry.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Who Should Join?
- AI/ML Enthusiasts (especially RAG & semantic search fans)
- SQL-savvy developers (data engineers, full-stack devs, data scientists)
- Existing MindsDB users & open-source contributors

## üîë Example Use Cases
- Decision BI Re-imagined ‚Üí NLQ ‚Üí KPIs/charts (with auditability).
- Operations Copilot ‚Üí Root cause & SOP search across tickets/wikis.
- Customer Intelligence ‚Üí 360¬∞ CRM + docs with explainable recs.
- Compliance & Controls ‚Üí Policy/filing QA with citations + risk flags.
- Wildcard ‚Üí Any creative KB-powered analytics app.

## üõ§Ô∏è Tracks

### Track 1: Build an application with MindsDB Knowledge Bases

Create a functional application (CLI, Web App, API, Bot Interface etc.) where the primary interaction or feature relies on the semantic query results from the KB. This includes:
  - A functional, empty Knowledge Base exists within their MindsDB instance (Cloud or local)
  - Participant connects a data source (Salesforce, Gong, Hubspot, Postgres or files) and successfully ingests text data into the KB using INSERT INTO. The KB is populated with text data suitable for semantic querying.
  - Demonstrate retrieving meaningful results based on semantic similarity and metadata filtering using [Hybrid Search](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/knowledge_bases/hybrid_search). Successfully retrieve relevant data chunks/rows based on semantic queries. 
  - Provide a public GitHub repo with clear setup instructions and documentation, along with a working application that demonstrates a practical use case for Knowledge Bases, supported by a short, shareable demo video showcasing the app in action.

### Track 2: Advanced Capabilities
- Jobs Integration: Auto-update KBs with [CREATE JOB](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/jobs).
- [Agent Integration](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent)
- Metadata Filtering: Hybrid search with semantic + structured filters for eg. LIKE and BETWEEN operators.
- [Evaluate Knowledge Bases](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/knowledge_bases/evaluate): Produce an evaluation report (MRR, Hit@k, relevancy, etc.).
- [Hybrid Search](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/knowledge_bases/hybrid_search): Perform semantic and metadata filtering queries on your data.

## üì¶ Deliverables/ Minimum Requirements
- Public GitHub repo with code + infra (Docker optional).
- README: problem statement(what use case this solves), architecture, KB schema, SQL examples, metrics.
- Demo UI (CLI or Web) + 5-min demo video
- Sample queries (Natural language + SQL).
- Evaluation report: metrics (MRR, Hit@k, avg relevancy, etc.).
- Blog post explaining how you built the application and what use case it solves.
- Social media posts on LinkedIn and Twitter about your project, mention @mindsdb.
