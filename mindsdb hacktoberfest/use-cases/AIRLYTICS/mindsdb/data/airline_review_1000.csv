They let us stay at the airport handing us a paper with contact for AF customer service, where after a longer wait they said they don’t know how to deal with the problem so they have to think about it - I guess not realizing we are under a time pressure and could miss the flight - already in pressure and missed the time we wanted to stay at the airport lounge.

PAL made adjustments three times until it already affected the connecting flight schedule, which PAL did not adjust. If I hadn’t informed them about this, it would have been a disaster.

The cabin crew was professional, courteous, and attentive, even passing out menus in economy which I haven't seen in years. Hot towels were passed out before landing, again a nice touch. After a smooth and wonderful flight, what spoiled everything was that not all of our luggage was delivered.

We had an hour delay due to a technical issue with one of the navigation instruments however Air France allowed us to stay in the terminal and not on the plane, something that I extremely appreciate. I was very disappointed, however, with fellow business class passengers for giving the crew a hard time because we were late due to the fact that they were trying to fix one of the navigational instruments.

When I got home, the customer service agents said that this was not what they said, and that they likely meant, your hotel might be reimbursed up to that amount.

From experience, they would rebook me to the next flight for free, if there are problems with the connection. And that is okay. But accommodation and food aren't included, though that's fine by me. With so many flights, I became a frequent flyer and their program is useful in terms of extra baggage allowance and priority tag, priority boarding, and lounge access.

None of this was of my doing - all decided by Philippine Airlines, and not one sensible reason ever given for any of the changes.

The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger.

One issue about the business class seats is that we can't see from the windows because of the seat conception which is inconvenient for a lot of passengers.

The Macau - Beijing route seems particularly liable to delay, but recently I have travelled on Air Macau to Hangzhou and Nanjing and both flights were 2 hours+ late, with little or no explanation. Air Macau gives the impression that it simply does not care.

One concern on flight GA088 to AMS was, there were a few passengers moving around the cabin without having a mask on.

Not even a magazine - which is now available by WiFi that you have to pay for. You have to pay for your seat choice, checked in baggage, food & drink, WiFi. Not that I have anything against that - I'm used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticket. I would have preferred to fly on easyJet where the initial ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been half the price.

The crew spoked both French and English, which makes a plus for the flight. To my surprise, the economy seats were equipped with personal IFE with the whole Air Canada inflight program. Food consisted of a cookie and a drink, which is more than enough for a one hour flight. The only downside of the flight was the delay created by bad luck. The aircraft was already late already and during taxi, when we were about to align on the runway, the tower decided to change of runway, making us 1 hour late.

The shuttle arrived late and picked up a family but we were left stranded by the driver who informed us that we were not on the list and he had no room for us as the shuttle was full.

Starting from a long check in with only some Jeju Air customer representative are visible at Macau Airport. Our flight was delay with no explanation from the airport which was making itself a 2 hour delay. As Jeju Air is a budget airline, you must pay for everything including changing seat, but then we boarded an old plane for an uncomfortable 3 hours and 30 minutes flight to South Korea.

Considering the premium seats cost almost 4 times the economy seats, I was really disappointed with the overall experience. Meal was exactly the same as what you receive in economy, as is the amenity kit. When compared to PE in Qantas or BA, this lacks a lot (you get meals and drink service more in line with business class on those carriers). The only advantage if you are a OneWorld Emerald or Sapphire is getting access to the Pier Lounge at Hong Kong Airport, otherwise if you don't have status and are looking for an upgrade other than just some extra leg room then I wouldn't recommend this.

Mine could not have the seatback brought fully up and clearly had a huge impression on the seat from a very heavy person. This made me ""roll"" into the center right of the seat the whole time. No IFE in first class. For the money you pay you would expect music at the very least. You have to log into GoGo and pay the extra. No access to the Admirals Club in the airport.

No information about the whereabouts of the aircraft or the whole waiting time was provided with time.

Your ticket includes nothing but 7kg of cabin baggage (and they do weigh rucksacks/handbags etc), a bottle of water and the seat you booked. Check in process was not good.

Free wifi for all passengers regardless of ticket type (both short and long haul) and operates gate to gate (so no annoying need to log in and out on take off and landing). The premium offering long haul is, I would say, better than most airlines' premium economy but not as good as business class. Yet the price is exceptionally low for what you get.
