They let us stay at the airport handing us a paper with contact for AF customer service, where after a longer wait they said they don’t know how to deal with the problem so they have to think about it - I guess not realizing we are under a time pressure and could miss the flight - already in pressure and missed the time we wanted to stay at the airport lounge.

PAL made adjustments three times until it already affected the connecting flight schedule, which PAL did not adjust. If I hadn’t informed them about this, it would have been a disaster.

The cabin crew was professional, courteous, and attentive, even passing out menus in economy which I haven't seen in years. Hot towels were passed out before landing, again a nice touch. After a smooth and wonderful flight, what spoiled everything was that not all of our luggage was delivered.

We had an hour delay due to a technical issue with one of the navigation instruments however Air France allowed us to stay in the terminal and not on the plane, something that I extremely appreciate. I was very disappointed, however, with fellow business class passengers for giving the crew a hard time because we were late due to the fact that they were trying to fix one of the navigational instruments.

When I got home, the customer service agents said that this was not what they said, and that they likely meant, your hotel might be reimbursed up to that amount.

From experience, they would rebook me to the next flight for free, if there are problems with the connection. And that is okay. But accommodation and food aren't included, though that's fine by me. With so many flights, I became a frequent flyer and their program is useful in terms of extra baggage allowance and priority tag, priority boarding, and lounge access.

None of this was of my doing - all decided by Philippine Airlines, and not one sensible reason ever given for any of the changes.

PAL's ground staff failed to communicate what is required of transit passengers in advance and made us go around in circles, doing unnecessary processes and had a horrible surprise at the boarding gate when we were told that we need to go to another location to have our check-in bags opened up for inspection just before our flight.

Staff confirmed in flight entertainment did not work on this plane. Should work on iPad or android device as there are no built in screens on Rouge. On flights to Europe they do provide a hot meal. It was very good (within north America you pay for food). The fees to pre-book seats are high, exorbitant for seats with more leg room. No longer a bargain flight. Standard seats are okay, as on air transat. Rouge MUST solve the in-flight entertainment.",Boeing 767,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Lisbon,19-Sep,3,3,3,4,1,1,3,no
492,Bangkok Airways,3,"""old planes, low legspace""",15th February 2019,True,"Bangkok to Phuket. Bangkok Airways bills itself as ""Asia's Boutique Airline"" which is a bit of a joke given their old planes, low legspace, lackluster food service, and no in flight entertainment. Just about the only thing that is boutique is the price. Flights are extremely expensive but Bangkok Airways runs a monopoly on many internal routes in Thailand, which let's them get away with it. The first leg was infested with mosquitos and the plane was rather old, but service was ok. Flight was delayed by 45 minutes which led to a tight connection, but staff were available to es ort us through immigration and to the next flight. The second flight was also an old but serviceable plane.

493,Iberia,2,"""have never seen such unhelpful, frankly lazy, and rude customer service""",15th June 2022,False,"The ground crew at check in at the JFK Airport in New York is the worst, without exception, that we have ever encountered! It is unbelievable that an airline could maintain such poor representation of their airline company and in fact they were so bad that somehow there appears to be terrible supervision and management. We flew from JFK-MAD on 6/5/22. The check in process started about 40 minutes after the time on the board and that could be caused by any number of reasons, but despite a long customer line for the full flight and about 6 people milling around behind their counter, no one ever explained anything and didn't even look at any of the passengers in line.

494,Vistara,9,"""eager to help and nothing was trouble at all""",4th May 2021,True,"Right from boarding to landing, Vistara conducted it's duty with utmost sincerity and dedication. Premium economy cabins are spacious and so are seats. Cabin planning is good. They secure cabin from Economy class hence it feels private and less loud. The mood light shades they use are really appealing and food is just fantastic! In fact all flights originating from India, serves fantastic food! Hands down it's the best meal I have eaten on-board a flight. While I am at it, I might add that they can be bit generous with serving portions. IFE is bit boring and it needs more variety and latest movies. All this on one side and their cabin crew on another side. They elevate the experience on to another level.

Flights between large European cities cost up to 100€ and more, also my flight from VIE to FCO was not cheap but Niki's service is not that good. The only thing Niki offers you compared to other airlines is a cold and ugly sandwich plus a soft drink but it is not worth the price. However the ground staff (which in fact were staff from the airport) were experienced and friendly. Despite that the cabin crew was unkind and sloppy and their english-skills had been disastrous.

499,Batik Air,8,"""experience is not heinously bad""",2nd May 2023,True,"Yogyakarta to Jakarta. Not the strongest of all starts for this flight as it was delayed by 35 minutes, causing me to feel anxious and panicked as this would mean missing my connection to Bangkok and eventually to Tokyo. The ground staff at Yogyakarta refused to rebook me to an earlier flight, but they kept their promises that my flight will leave before 3 in the afternoon, which is a good thing. The seat was comfortable for a 50-minute hop, and because I was assigned an emergency exit seat, more legroom is guaranteed. Crews were just okay; not rude but also not too friendly. Light meals were served for this 50-minute flight, which consisted of bread and a bottle of water.
