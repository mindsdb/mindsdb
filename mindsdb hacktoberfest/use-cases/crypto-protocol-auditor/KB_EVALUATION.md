## Advanced Metrics Explained

### Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)

**What:** Position of first relevant result in rankings  
**Score:** 1.0 (first result always relevant)  
**Meaning:** Users find answers immediately  

Per-query results: All 8 test categories achieved MRR 1.0

### Hit@K (Hit Rate at Top-K)

**What:** Whether any relevant result appears in top-K  
**Scores:**
- Hit@5: 1.0 (all queries have relevant results in top-5)
- Hit@10: 1.0 (all queries have relevant results in top-10)

**Meaning:** Users will always find something relevant in top results

### NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)

**What:** Ranking quality considering position (higher ranks weighted more)  
**Score:** 1.0 (perfect ranking quality)  
**Meaning:** Results are ranked in ideal order

Formula: NDCG = DCG / IDCG (normalized to ideal ranking)

### Precision@K

**What:** Proportion of relevant results in top-K  
**Scores:**
- Precision@5: 1.0 (all top-5 results are relevant)
- Precision@10: 0.45 (4-5 of top-10 results are relevant)

**Meaning:** High precision at top-5, good precision at top-10

### Average Relevancy

**What:** Mean of all relevance scores  
**Score:** 0.4597 (46% of results are relevant)  
**Meaning:** Good coverage with some non-relevant results (expected in large KB)

### Average Entropy

**What:** Confidence in model decisions  
**Score:** 3.5351 (good confidence)  
**Meaning:** Model is confident about result relevance

## How to Schedule Re-evaluation

### Quarterly Evaluation
```bash
# Run quarterly (every 3 months) to track KB growth
python advanced_kb_evaluate.py
# Review results in kb_evaluation_results/
```

### Post-Update Evaluation
After adding/updating knowledge base:
```bash
# Verify changes didn't degrade metrics
python kb_evaluate.py
python advanced_kb_evaluate.py
```

### Continuous Monitoring (Future)
- Set up automated evaluation pipeline
- Track metrics trends over time
- Alert if any metric drops below threshold
