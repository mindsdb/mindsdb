# Crypto Protocol Auditor

The Web3 world is exploding. New protocols launch daily, each with a dense, complex, and often boring whitepaper. For an investor, developer, or enthusiast, trying to find the right sources, understand technical consensus mechanisms, and track market changes is a disconnected nightmare of tabs and data silos. The Crypto Protocol Auditor solves this. It's an AI-powered auditor, built on MindsDB, that unifies this scattered data into one conversational interface. You can instantly feed the system unstructured data like PDF whitepapers and structured data like project info from your database. Immediately, you can ask natural language questions to get simple answers from complex documents, compare the technical specs of multiple protocols side-by-side, and—most powerfully—get a real-time, 360-degree view by asking for live price activity from CoinGecko and current market sentiment from live news articles, all in one place.

## 🎯 What It Does

**Hybrid Search** combines knowledge base, live prices, and sentiment analysis in one query:
- 📚 **Knowledge Base**: Provide as much documents and cryptocurrency data as you want
- 💰 **Live Prices**: Real-time market data (price, market cap, 24h change)
- 📈 **Sentiment Analysis**: Market mood (bullish/bearish/neutral) from latest news and link to the most relevant sources/articles
- 🔀 **Protocol Comparison**: Side-by-side analysis of 2-5 protocols

## 🏗️ System Architecture

![Crypto Protocol Auditor Architecture](./assets/crypto_auditor_architecture.jpg)

### Architecture Overview

**Zone 1: Frontend (User Layer)**
- Next.js + React with TypeScript
- Dark theme UI (responsive)
- Real-time search, comparison, and sentiment displays

**Zone 2: Backend (API Routes)**
- `/api/agent/query` - Main orchestrator (hybrid search)
- `/api/sentiment` - Market sentiment analysis
- `/api/compare` - Protocol comparison
- `/api/prices` - Live pricing (cached)
- `/api/search` - Direct KB search

**Zone 3: MindsDB (AI Brain)**
- Agent engine (connects to your LLM provider)
- Knowledge base (112+ documents via PGVector embeddings)
- News database for sentiment analysis
- Multi-source data integration

**Zone 4: Data Layer**
- Vector database (PGVector embeddings)
- Price source (e.g., CoinGecko, Binance)
- News source (e.g., NewsAPI)
- Metadata storage (e.g., Neon Postgres)
