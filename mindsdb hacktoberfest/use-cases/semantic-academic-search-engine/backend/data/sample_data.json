        "abstract": "Kinases are enzymes that catalyze phosphorylation and play crucial roles in a myriad of cellular regulatory processes and hemostasis. Patient-specific genetic mutations that aberrantly activate kinases can profoundly influence cancer progression and alter drug efficacy. Predicting the impact of such missense mutations across the human kinome on protein function and cellular signaling is therefore a critical step toward personalized targeted therapy. Here, we present Kinome-AI, an integrative machine learning framework that classifies kinase missense mutations as activating or non-activating. Kinome-AI is trained on a rich multi-modal feature set, including residue-level biochemical changes, sequence embeddings from a protein language model, and structural descriptors of kinase-ATP-substrate complexes derived from molecular modeling. Notably, detailed structural features were available for only 21% of mutants; we leverage these as privileged information during training to impute missing structural data for the remaining [~]79. This strategy boosts performance without requiring structural inputs for new (unseen) mutations. The resulting classifier achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.85 and a balanced accuracy (BACC) of 0.76 across 1,003 mutations spanning 110 different kinases --substantially outperforming existing bioinformatics and general-purpose variant effect predictors. This work provides a robust approach to quantify sequence-structure- function relationships of cancer-driving kinase mutations, paving the way for improved personalized cancer treatment.\n\nSignificance StatementIn cancer patients, numerous mutations in diverse protein kinases lead to marked differences in disease progression and drug response. Identifying which kinase mutations are activating in individual patients is therefore critical for precision oncology. Drawing inspiration from teacher- student (privileged information) learning, we developed a deep learning framework that integrates structural features from molecular simulations with sequence embeddings from protein language models. This approach enables accurate binary classification of the activation status of kinase mutations. Our study demonstrates how data-driven algorithms can leverage accumulated sequence and structural knowledge of known mutations to predict the effects of novel variants a priori. The model, termed Kinome-AI, shows significant promise for incorporation into personalized cancer therapy decision pipelines.",

Current approaches rely on several specialized tools for different data modalities, leading to inefficient workflows and computational overhead. Here, we present momics, a unified framework to consolidate multi-omics data in a single repository and interrogate it with a high-performance query engine. Compared to existing tools, momics ingests genomic sequences, feature annotations, and unlimited coverage tracks into TileDB-backed repositories, and provides a scalable query engine for concurrent multi-modal queries across millions of genomic loci.

        "abstract": "Absence epilepsy is a generalized seizure disorder marked by widespread spike-and-wave oscillations and sudden lapses in consciousness. Although no consensus exists on mechanisms of consciousness, several frameworks highlight dynamic processes relying on cortical and thalamocortical feedback loops. What those dynamics entail is an open question. Here, using interpretable machine learning, we identified a system of dynamical equations reproducing absence seizure dynamics directly from electrocorticogram recordings. The data-generated and human-interpretable model entailed multiarea synchronization on a chaotic attractor, challenging the idea of a single cortical or thalamic origin. The model contained several interconnected feedback loops which are stabilized at particular phase offsets to drive the emergence of the large amplitude seizure oscillations. High-density multielectrode recordings revealed a synchronized seizure network linking cortical layer 5 neurons of the somatosensory and motor systems with the posterior thalamic nucleus (PO), a higher order thalamic nucleus driving cortical and thalamic bursting which corresponded to the model coupling functions. Multisite optogenetics and multielectrode recordings then showed PO acts as timing-dependent gate of cortico-cortical L5 connectivity to promote the seizures. Overall, our work identifies absence seizures as corresponding to the confinement of dynamics on an attractor which relies on the same circuit substrate as has been identified for loss of consciousness in general anesthesia. This work introduces a unified approach to identify, explain, and test how distributed network instabilities contribute to a disorder of consciousness and provides an explicit dynamical framework describing the underlying multiarea feedback loops.",

        "abstract": "Identifying amino acid changes that lead to phenotypic change is a central problem that is critical to viral surveillance. Common metrics used to measure protein evolution like site-wise evolutionary rates and entropy are truly measures of variability rather than phenotypic importance. Here I show that supervised, explainable machine learning models provide a complementary approach that could serve to date and classify sequences, identify important mutations for host adaptation, and control directly for confounding covariates like sampling date and geography of origin. I curated 39,121 hemagglutinin (H3) protein sequences from GISAID with passage annotations and associated sample metadata to create models of sequence change. Gradient boosted decision trees were trained with encoded amino acids plus latitude, longitude, and date; SHAP values quantified site importance. The passage classifier achieved 81% overall accuracy (balanced accuracy = 0.77), distinguishing egg grown from unpassaged isolates with nearly 90% recall, and recovering known and novel adaptive substitutions. A separate regressor, trained solely on unpassaged sequences, predicted sample collection date with R2 = 0.98 and a mean absolute error of 74.5 days. Crucially, the sites identified as most important by the models showed a strong enrichment for experimentally validated antigenic sites, with the passage model ranking these functionally critical residues far more effectively than traditional evolutionary metrics. Across both tasks, correlations between SHAP values and standard evolutionary metrics were strong (0.63[&le;] {rho} [&le;] 0.9), indicating a strong connection between importance and variability depending on model specification. These results demonstrate that explainable machine learning can reveal important substitutions, deliver tree free molecular dating, and may transform passage metadata from a nuisance into an experimental probe.",

Normalization methods attempt to compensate, but rely on strong, often untestable assumptions that can bias inference. Experimental measurements of load (e.g., qPCR, flow cytometry) offer a solution, but remain costly and uncommon. A recent high-profile study proposed that machine learning could bypass this limitation by predicting microbial load from sequencing data alone. To evaluate this claim, we assembled mutt, the largest public database of paired sequencing and load measurements, spanning 35 studies and over 15,000 samples. Using mutt, we show that published machine learning models fail to generalize: on average they perform worse than a naive baseline that always predicted the training set mean. These failures stem from covariate shift-limited shared taxa between studies, differences in community composition, and differences in preprocessing pipelines-that silently derail model inputs. In contrast, Bayesian partially identified models do not attempt to impute microbial load, but instead propagate scale uncertainty through downstream analyses. Across 30 benchmark datasets, Bayesian partially identified models consistently outperformed normalization and machine learning approaches, providing a principled and reproducible foundation for microbiome inference.",

Short peptides have emerged as promising vectors, including cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) and brain-penetrating peptides (BPPs). However, the structural and physicochemical features that distinguish CPPs from BPPs remain poorly understood, limiting rational design. Here, we compiled a curated dataset of 490 peptides, encompassing CPPs, BPPs, and non-BPP controls, and systematically analysed their amino acid composition, sequence distribution, and physicochemical descriptors. BPPs were found to exhibit a more balanced distribution of cationic, polar, and hydrophobic residues compared to CPPs, which were enriched in contiguous arginine and lysine blocks. Physicochemical analysis revealed that BPPs had lower charge density, greater stability, and reduced aromaticity relative to CPPs. Dimensionality reduction confirmed BPPs occupy an intermediate chemical space between CPPs and non-BPPs. Machine learning classification, particularly with Extra Trees models, achieved strong performance in discriminating peptide classes, with charge, instability index, and aromaticity identified as the most predictive features. These findings suggest that BBB penetration is not a simple extension of cell penetration but requires finely tuned physicochemical properties. This study provides mechanistic insights into BPP design and highlights machine learning as a valuable tool for engineering next-generation BBB-penetrating peptides and peptide-mimetic materials.",

Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of machine learning methods for assessing and continuously monitoring dyspnea using easily obtained noninvasive biomarkers.\n\nMethodsWe recruited healthy participants (N = 60, 35 women) and stimulated dyspnea using a forced end-tidal semi-rebreathing circuit to modulate arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide levels while collecting non-invasive biomarker data and continuous self-reported dyspnea severity scores.

Here, we present a machine learning model to predict siRNA efficacy directly from intrinsic antisense sequence features. Using a dataset of 2,428 experimentally validated siRNAs, we developed a comprehensive feature set that encompasses sequence composition, regulatory motifs, thermodynamic parameters, and structural complexity. We trained and evaluated multiple models for both regression and classification tasks.

Among all features, position-specific nucleotides were the strongest predictors of efficacy, with a uracil at the 5' antisense end (P1_U) and an adenine at the 3' end (P19_A) showing the highest importance, consistent with known mechanisms of strand selection and RISC loading.

Mice undergoing naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal were recorded and analyzed using DeepLabCut for markerless pose estimation.

The annotations and pose data were then imported into Active learning Segmentation of Open field in DeepLabCut (A-SOiD), an active learning platform for behavior classification. A-SOiD successfully detected some behaviors (e.g., grooming and rearing) which were of a longer duration, though other rapid behaviors (e.g., jumping and paw tremors) were inconsistently captured. While no novel behavioral motifs have been discovered yet, ongoing work aims to refine model performance.

        "abstract": "Introduction: Transcriptomic biomarker discovery has been a challenge due to variation in datasets and platforms, complexity in statistical and computational methods, integration of multiple programming languages, and intricacy of ML workflow to evaluate biomarkers. Standard workflows necessitate several stages (quality control, normalization, differential expression), typically executed in R or Python, resulting in bottlenecks for non-experts. Existing platforms have alleviated certain challenges by offering graphical interfaces for data loading, normalization, differential gene expression analysis, and functional analysis; nevertheless, they typically do not incorporate integrated machine learning procedures for biomarker selection. Method: In this regard, we present omicML, an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that combines transcriptomic data analysis with machine learning (ML)-based classification via integrating R and Python packages/libraries. It supports both RNA-Seq and microarray data, automating preprocessing (data import, quality control, and normalization) and differential expression analysis. The tool annotates differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with descriptions, gene ontology, and pathway information and incorporates comparative analysis. Our extensive ML pipeline enables both supervised and unsupervised learning, integrates various datasets based on candidate gene signatures, standardizes and eliminates less significant features, benchmarks multiple ML classifiers with robust performance metrics (e.g., AUROC, AUPRC), assesses feature importance, develops single-gene and multi-gene predictive models, and systematically finalizes the biomarker algorithm. All functionalities are available in omicML, hence reducing the barrier for biologists without computational proficiency. Result: In a case study, omicML identified a six-gene diagnostic model that distinguishes Mpox (monkeypox virus) infections from those caused by other viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, HIV, Ebola, and varicella-zoster. These results illustrate omicML's capacity to discern clinically relevant biomarkers from complex transcriptome data. Conclusion: Through the unified system, omicML (https://omicml.org), integrating data preprocessing, differential gene expression analysis, annotation, heatmap analysis, dataset integration, batch effect correction, machine learning approach, and functional analysis can diminish technical barriers and accelerates the conversion of expression data into diagnostic insights for clinicians and bench scientists.",

        "abstract": "Asthma is a complex condition characterized by chronic airway inflammation, with varying severity, symptoms, triggers, and treatment responses. Traditional classification relies on clinical attributes, but the growing understanding of asthmas heterogeneity highlights the need for phenotyping. Effective management requires regular monitoring, medication, and prevention of exacerbations, but current diagnostic methods face challenges such as the lack of definitive tests and reliance on subjective measures. Implementing precision medicine, especially for severe cases, necessitates identifying measurable markers in biofluids. This study explores machine learning methods to identify biomarkers differentiating various asthma phenotypic states. We measured inflammatory markers in both plasma and saliva samples and used machine learning algorithms to determine their efficacy in reflecting airway inflammation. Our findings indicate that saliva markers provide a more accurate representation of localized inflammation compared to plasma markers, which reflect a systemic response. Using MRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance) ranking, we enhanced model efficacy. The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier achieved 75% accuracy with the first 12 saliva markers, while the Random Forest (RF) classifier performed best for plasma models, though with lower accuracy. Our results suggest machine learning can effectively identify key markers for asthma phenotyping, aiding personalized treatment strategies. Customizable point-of-care devices could validate these models and improve their accuracy, advancing asthma treatment and management.",

In our proposed model we used TAC 2017 Dataset, which has Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) data for the classification ofdrug-drug interaction. TAC 2017 Dataset has various types of information which are related to drugs and their interactions. Our method uses Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to transform the textual descriptions ofside effects for DDI into numerical feature vectors, followed by a Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting, BioBERT, Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithms to predict the potential interactions between drug pairs. One of the key strength of the Random Forest approach is its ability to provide feature importance scores, which allows us to interpret which side effects are most influential in predicting drug interactions. The key advantage of Gradient Boosting is its high predictive performance combined with interpretability. It is able to handle complex, structured data efficiently. Additionally, the models decisions are more transparent, which is necessary in the biomedical domain. The advantageof SVM is its ability to handle high-dimensional data, capture complex non-linear interactions using kernel functions, and generalize with datasets, making it robust to over-fitting. BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining) is advantageous for DDI prediction due to its biomedical domain knowledge, contextual understanding of complex drug-related texts.These method captures the relevance and importance of each side effect of multi drugs and also generate pairs of drugs from the dataset. Our model demonstrates competitive performance in DDI prediction, which highlights the utility of text-based feature extraction combined with an interpretable ensemble learning model.",

This study presents a gradient-boosted ensemble framework trained on precomputed molecular fingerprints to classify compounds as BBB-permeable (BBB+) or non-permeable (BBB-). The 2048-bit fingerprints encode substructural information relevant to passive diffusion without requiring explicit physicochemical descriptors. The model, trained on experimentally annotated BBB datasets using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE) to address class imbalance, achieved strong predictive performance (cross-validated ROC-AUC = 0.897 +/- 0.019; validation ROC-AUC = 0.932). External testing on literature-reported CNS-active compounds (Caffeine, Diazepam, Dopamine, and Levodopa) confirmed biological consistency: highly lipophilic drugs were predicted as BBB+, while polar molecules dependent on carrier-mediated transport were predicted as BBB-. The fingerprint-based model thus captures underlying permeability mechanisms through data-driven substructure learning. This approach eliminates the need for handcrafted descriptors while preserving interpretability through feature-importance analysis, establishing a reproducible, efficient, and explainable baseline for virtual BBB permeability screening in CNS drug development.",

To supplement rDock, here we introduce the Intelligent RNA Interaction Scorer (IRIS), a regression model leveraging physicochemical and interaction-based features and trained on the largest dataset of experimental nucleic acid-ligand complexes compiled to date (1,356 structures). IRIS improves rDock RNA-ligand pose ranking relative to the use of rDock scores alone. We find that at least one of the 100 top generated poses for any given complex is within 2.0 [A] RMSD of the native pose in 79.4% of test complexes. Of these 79.4%%, the default rDock scoring function ranks the correct pose first in 40.2% of cases. IRIS improves this latter fraction to 52.7% and increases the success rate for selecting a near-native pose among the top five ranked poses from 55.4% to 73.2%. IRIS thus significantly enhances pose ranking accuracy and can be seamlessly integrated into docking pipelines to refine ligand poses in RNA-targeted drug discovery.",

Accelerometers, which measure changes in acceleration across planes of movement, are increasingly being used in conjunction with machine learning models to classify animal behaviours across taxa and research questions.

Our approach integrates machine learning and statistical inference techniques to evaluate and mitigate class imbalances, changes in model performance across ecological settings, and noisy classifications. Importantly, we extend predictions from single behaviour classifications to prediction sets: sets of behaviour labels guaranteed to contain the true behaviour with a pre-specified probability, in a framework analogous to the use of prediction intervals in statistical analyses.\nC_LIO_LIWe evaluate our approach via simulation and highlight its utility using data collected from a free-ranging large carnivore, African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. We demonstrate significantly improved predictions along with associated uncertainty metrics in African wild dog behaviour classification, particularly for rare and ecologically important behaviours such as feeding, where correct classifications more than doubled following quality checks and data rebalancing introduced in our pipeline.\nC_LIO_LIOur approach is applicable across taxa and represents a key step towards advancing the burgeoning use of machine learning to remotely observe around-the-clock behaviours of free-ranging animals.

Pathogens acquire AMR much faster than we discover new drugs (antibiotics), warranting innovative methods to better understand its molecular underpinnings. Traditional approaches for detecting AMR in novel bacterial strains are time-consuming and labor-intensive. However, advances in sequencing technology offer a plethora of bacterial genome data, and computational approaches like machine learning (ML) provide an optimistic scope for in silico AMR prediction. Here, we introduce a comprehensive multiscale ML approach to predict AMR phenotypes and identify AMR molecular features associated with a single drug or drug family, stratified by time and geographical locations. As a case study, we focus on a subset of the World Health Organizations Bacterial Priority Pathogens, the frequently drug-resistant and nosocomial ESKAPE pathogens: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species. We started with sequenced genomes with lab-derived AMR phenotypes, constructed pangenomes, clustered gene and protein sequences, and extracted protein domains to generate pangenomic features across molecular scales. To uncover the molecular mechanisms behind drug-/drug class-specific resistance, we trained logistic regression ML models on our datasets. These yielded ranked lists of AMR-associated genes, proteins, and domains. In addition to recapitulating known AMR features, our models identified novel candidates for experimental validation. The models were performant across molecular scales, data types, and drugs while achieving a median normalized Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.89. Prediction performance showed resilience even when evaluated on geographical and temporal holdouts. We also evaluated model generalizability and cross-resistance across the drug-/drug class-specific models cross-tested on other available drug-/drug class genomes. Finally, we uncovered multiple drug class resistance features using multiclass and multilabel models. Our holistic approach promises reliable prediction of existing and developing resistance in newly sequenced pathogen genomes, while pinpointing the mechanistic molecular contributors of AMR.

Despite the increasing prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA) in humans, investigation of glycosylation changes associated with OA remains in its infancy. Recent advances, such as lectin microarray analysis, now enable detailed glycan profiling in complex biofluids such as synovial fluid. Using lectin microarray technology, this study characterized glycosylation patterns in synovial fluid samples from healthy and OA-affected joints in horses, dogs, and humans. Comparative glycan-binding profiles within and between species revealed conserved and distinct glycomic signatures associated with OA. Machine learning models, including classification algorithms, effectively distinguished OA from healthy joints, identifying key lectins and glycan epitopes crucial to these predictions. The identified lectin markers reflect specific glycosylation pathways and potential inflammatory mechanisms, demonstrating their value in differentiating between healthy and OA phenotypes.

This limitation has spurred the development of quicker, alignment-free alternatives, such as k-mer analysis, which are crucial for studying long noncoding ribonucleic acids (lncRNAs) in plants. These lncRNAs play critical roles in regulating gene expression at both the epigenetic and transcriptomic levels. However, existing alignmentfree approaches typically lose positional information, which can be vital for achieving accurate classification. We propose positional frequency chaos game representation (PFCGR), a novel encoding that improves the traditional frequency chaos game representation (FCGR) by incorporating four statistical moments of k-mer positions: mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. This creates a multi-channel image representation of genomic sequences, enabling machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Convolutional Neural Networks to classify plant lncRNAs directly from raw genomic sequences. Tested on seven major crop species, our PFCGR-based classifiers achieve classification accuracies comparable to or exceeding those of the computationally intensive DNABERT-based model [1], while requiring 80% to 95% less computational time. These results demonstrate PFCGRs potential as an efficient and accurate tool for plant lncRNA identification, as well as its ability to facilitate large-scale computational studies in genomics.",

Because current holistic (meta-omics) and reductionist (isolation- or single-cell-based) approaches struggle to capture these emergent microbial community functions, this study explores an intermediate strategy: analyzing simple sub-community combinations to enable a bottom-up understanding of community-level functions. To examine the validity of this approach, we used a nine-member synthetic microbial community capable of degrading the environmental pollutant aniline, and systematically generated a dataset of 256 sub-community combinations and their associated functions. Analyses using random forest models revealed that the sub-community combinations of just three to four species enabled the quantitative prediction of functions in larger communities (5-9-member; Pearsons r = 0.78-0.80). Prediction performance remained robust even with limited sub-community data, suggesting applicability to more diverse microbial communities where exhaustive sub-community observation is infeasible. Moreover, interpreting models trained on these simple sub-community combinations enabled the identification of key species and interspecies interactions that strongly influence the overall community function. These findings provide a methodological framework for mechanistically dissecting complex microbial community functions through sub-community-based analysis.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning has proven to be very powerful for predicting mutation effects in proteins, but the simplest approaches require a substantial amount of training data. Because experiments to collect training data are often expensive, time-consuming, and/or otherwise limited, alternatives that make good use of small amounts of data to guide protein engineering are of high potential value. One potential alternative to large-scale benchtop experiments for collecting training data is high-throughput molecular dynamics simulation; however, to date this source of data has been largely absent from the literature. Here, I introduce a new method for selecting desirable protein variants based on quantified relationships between a small number of experimentally determined labels and descriptors of their dynamic properties. These descriptors are provided by deep neural networks trained on data from molecular dynamics simulations of variants of the protein of interest. I demonstrate that this approach can obtain very highly optimized variants based on small amounts of experimental data, outperforming alternative supervised approaches to machine learning-guided directed evolution with the same amount of experimental data. Furthermore, I show that quantified dynamics-property relationships based on only a handful of experimentally labeled example sequences can be used to accurately predict the key residues that are most relevant to determining the property in question, even when that information could not have been known or predicted based on either the molecular dynamics simulations or the experimental data alone. This work establishes a new and practical framework for incorporating general protein dynamics information from simulations of mutants to guide protein engineering.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/650227v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@302943org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e4f709org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1167c20org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12f3627_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOToc GraphicC_FLOATNO C_FIG",

The limited amount of drug substance available during development, coupled with extensive analytical requirements, restrict the number of excipients that can be empirically screened. There is a strong need for in silico tools to optimize excipient pre-selection before wet lab experiments. Here, we introduce Excipient Prediction Software (ExPreSo), a supervised machine learning algorithm that suggests excipients based on the properties of the protein drug substance and target product profile. ExPreSo was trained on a dataset comprising 335 regulatory-approved peptide and protein drug products. Predictive features included protein structural properties, protein language model embeddings, and drug product characteristics. ExPreSo showed good performance for the nine most prevalent excipients in biopharmaceutical formulations and minimal overfitting. A fast variant of ExPreSo using only sequence-based input features showed similar prediction power to slower models that relied on molecular modeling. Notably, an ExPreSo variant using only protein-based input features also showed good performance, indicating resilience to the influence of platform formulations. To our knowledge, this is the first machine learning algorithm to suggest biopharmaceutical excipients based on the dataset of regulatory-approved drug products. Overall, ExPreSo shows great potential to reduce the time, costs, and risks associated with excipient screening during formulation development.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=77 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/637685v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2e3e5corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@342aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@160df8forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f547d8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

To address this, we developed the Predictive Cellular Senescence Model (PreCSenM), a machine learning-based tool that assigns a CS score by integrating senescence-associated features across 888 samples. Benchmarking analyses confirmed that PreCSenM markedly outperforms existing methodologies in reliably predicting senescent states within both normal and cancerous transcriptomic datasets. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), PreCSenM identified the CS score as a robust predictor of clinical outcomes. Multi-omics analyses further revealed that lower CS levels correlate with decreased genomic stability and enhanced immune responses, aligning with clinical observations. Notably, drug discovery using PreCSenM identified histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) as potent inducers of CS in LUAD. Transcriptional and epigenetic profiling of HDACi-treated cells pinpointed FOSB as a core transcription factor driving CS, and FOSB knockdown blocked HDACi-induced senescence. Overall, our study establishes PreCSenM as a multidimensional senescence quantification tool, bridging computational prediction with clinical relevance and mechanistic validation to enable senescence-directed therapies in precision oncology.",

To overcome these limitations, we introduce a computational framework that integrates cross-species comparative genomics and machine learning to identify functional genes for shared phenotypes, independent of prior annotation. Our method links orthologous gene group (OG) profiles to specific traits, enabling the powerful discovery of functional genes across diverse evolutionary clades. For plant-arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, a notoriously difficult system, our model pinpointed a regulatory network by identifying 27 core plant-AM symbiosis genes among its top 50 candidate OGs, including the critical receptor SYMRK. The approach also proved highly effective for identifying functional genes related to the tested vertebrate skeletal development and multiple bacterial traits. Most notably, for bacterial motility, our model not only identified 63 known motility genes from the top 100 candidate OGs (of which 78 are present in Escherichia coli) but also guided the experimental validation of three novel essential genes. This annotation-independent strategy represents a paradigm shift in functional genomics, offering a scalable and universal engine to decode the genetic architecture of complex traits and illuminate the vast  functional dark matter across the tree of life.",

According to CAZy, there are eight families of LPMO namely AA9, AA10, AA11, AA13, AA14, AA15, AA16, and AA17, where AA stands for Auxiliary Activity. Previously, using the sequence information machine learning-based functional annotation was successfully completed using neural network and LSTM models. This was done for AA9 and AA10 as the number of sequences was large enough to train a model with high-performance indices. Here, the goal is to use existing 3D structures and AI-based models of the remaining LPMO sequences and train a machine learning model to identify and classify LPMO with the help of structural features by performing either a neural network algorithm or other suitable methods. Using the features of LPMO such as surface depth, accessible area, electrostatic charge distribution, and geometric features (independent features that define the shape and are not based on enzyme reaction mechanism) we will identify the features with high signal-to-noise ratio/significance using ensemble feature selection method. The features were extracted using Pymol, MdTraj, Biopython, Open3d, and Bio3D tools from OBJ and STL format. The model thus trained using structural features will enable identifying and annotating newer LPMO sequences belonging to one of the eight AA families.",

Here, we present a machine learning (ML) based framework that identifies subtle postural alterations in freely behaving animals. Using longitudinal pose data from SOD1G93A mice, a widely used Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) mouse model, we focused on postural states in idle periods, behavioral states usually overlooked in disease monitoring. Our analyses revealed consistent deviations in posture and a feature analysis pinpointed cervical instability during adolescence as a key distinguishing feature. We validated these findings through two independent behavioral assays engaging cervical musculature: rearing and wet-dog shakes, both of which showed significant impairments in male SOD1G93A mice as early as 3 weeks of age, many weeks earlier than conventional muscle function assays. This approach establishes an unbiased, non-invasive, scalable strategy for detecting early-stage neuromuscular dysfunction, and provides a foundation both for clinical behavioral biomarker development in ALS and related disorders and will enable evaluation of early neuroprotective interventions.",

One way to address this challenge is via computational genotype-to-phenotype models that determine how particular sequence features correlate with protein expression levels. The potential of such approaches is yet to be fully realised, at least partly because so few expression datasets are available. Here, we study the sequence-to-expression relationships of a library of 12,248 membrane proteins derived from combinatorial computational design. The expression phenotype of the entire library is assessed in the widely-used recombinant host Escherichia coli. We employed selected phenotypic data to train a sequence-to-expression predictor using supervised machine learning, which achieved high classification accuracy on held-out test sequences. This model was then used to infer the expression of >10,000 unmeasured sequences, and validation of the top predictions of both high and low expressers achieved 100% success rate. Using tools from explainable AI, we identified specific sequence positions and substitutions that are most important in dictating cellular expression levels. This analysis was validated by model-guided protein engineering that achieved an 8-fold increase in the purification yield of a poorly-expressing variant. We find that cells accumulate elevated levels of transcript mRNA for high-expressing proteins, and speculate that this arises from efficient translation-coupled membrane insertion which minimises transcript degradation. Our results show that computational protein design in tandem with supervised learning leads to effective models for the discovery of protein variants with improved expression phenotypes, and can decode the molecular basis of membrane protein expression.",

The most predictive features were Bertz complexity (importance: 0.173), molecular shape descriptors (0.159), and molar refractivity (0.145), while traditional drug-like properties such as LogP showed lower importance (0.056).

Compounds with intermediate structural complexity (Bertz complexity: 400-600) demonstrated optimal binding affinity. The model successfully identified key molecular scaffolds including flavonoids and terpenoids, aligning with known natural product TLR4 modulators. This work provides the first comprehensive machine learning analysis of TLR4 binding determinants and offers a computational framework for rational design of TLR4-targeted therapeutics, with identified molecular features providing actionable insights for developing next-generation immunomodulatory drugs.",

Typically, the number of molecules in the asymmetric unit is not known and probabilistic methods are used based on statistics derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).

Here multiple machine learning approaches are investigated to predict solvent content using Patterson Maps. Several architectures are shown to give a significant improvement over current approaches, with prediction errors being reduced by over 50%.

The study has involved the analysis of genome-based compositional bias, promoter maps, codon adaptation index, protein structure, and characterized these genomic regions on the basis of predicting protein interactions and metabolic models. Although most of the currently in use pathogenicity islands finder software detect the presence of three pathogenicity islands, our analysis suggests that only one is present. Furthermore, we have investigated and discussed the metabolic advantages of pathogenicity, particularly iron ion scavenging activity. Our work has two immediate and important benefits: the improved understanding of the biological processes that shape the pathogenicity and evolution of Fusobacterium nucleatum at the molecular level and the improved ability to integrate and automate the state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools and machine learning approaches in the inference of the mechanistic interpretability of a pathogenic phenotype.",

        "abstract": "Real-time sleep stage classification is important for closed-loop neuromodulation at certain stages during sleep, yet current models often yield noisy and unstable outputs that risk false triggers. These fluctuations, especially near stage boundaries, can compromise the safety and reliability of stimulation. Existing methods frequently rely on model-specific architectures or require extensive tuning to maximize precision, which limits their generalizability and hinders deployment in real-time systems. To address this, we propose a lightweight, classifier-independent post-processing pipeline that stabilizes predictions without modifying the underlying classifier. Our method first applies temporal smoothing to predicted sleep-stage probabilities, followed by conservative control logic to enhance stimulation precision. We evaluate four smoothing techniques: Moving Average (MA), Exponential Smoothing (ES), Kalman Filtering (KF), and a novel Weighted Exponential Smoothing (WES), on a 29-subject open-source sleep dataset. To capture the trade-offs between stability and responsiveness, we introduce new real-time evaluation metrics. We identify an optimal smoothing intensity range and assess three control strategies: probability thresholding, naive waiting, and entropy constraint, as well as a hybrid method combining high confidence and low uncertainty. Smoothing improves generalization and robustness: under both low and high synthetic noise ({sigma} > 0.2), smoothed outputs retain 10-15% higher precision and recall across all stages. Control logic further enhances reliability: our hybrid method achieves 80% (Wake), 96% (N2), 98% (N3), and 86% (REM) precision. Finally, we introduce a stage-transition constraint matrix to suppress biologically implausible transitions (e.g., REM[-&gt;] N3), to further stabilize outputs during evidence accumulation, with potential applications in objective sleep quality assessment. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically characterize real-time trade-offs between smoothing, latency, and control logic in sleep staging. Overall, our generalizable framework is expected to improve safety, interpretability, and deployment feasibility of real-time sleep classification for both clinical and wearable closed-loop neuromodulation systems.",

Microbiome dysbiosis has been strongly associated with CRC development, with diet and demographic factors playing an important role in shaping gut microbial composition. Since most CRC cases are diagnosed at advanced stages, early detection remains critical for improving patient outcomes. Machine learning (ML) approaches provide a promising strategy to identify predictive microbial biomarkers for early CRC detection. In this study, we have analyzed publicly available 16S rRNA datasets comprising CRC patients and controls from South Asian cohorts (India and Sri Lanka) and compared them with Western cohorts (USA). Our findings revealed a higher relative abundance of Prevotella in South Asian cohorts, whereas Bacteroides predominated in the USA cohort. Across all three datasets, Fusobacterium, Escherichia-Shigella, and Akkermansia were consistently elevated in CRC cases. We evaluated multiple ML algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LogitBoost, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and proposed stacked ensemble model to differentiate between CRC and controls. Stacked ensemble model has higher accuracy compared to base models. To improve models interpretability and transparency SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis were performed to identify key taxa influencing model predictions.

By employing a two-phase labeling approach that utilizes polygon and brush segmentation, along with refinement using SAM2, we developed a high-quality MN segmentation tool. Subsequent data augmentation, which captured heterogeneity in image quality and color diversity, enabled us to train a generalizable Mask-RCNN model optimized for small object detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in MN detection. Finally, we applied our model to immunofluorescence data obtained from cell lines exposed to DNA damage conditions to gain biological insights into MN dynamics and their role in inducing genome instability.

Consequently, clinicians usually prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics, promoting the selection of multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this study, we investigate the application of machine learning techniques to detect ampicillin susceptibility directly from MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. This technique could enable an earlier optimised treatment in infections with ampicillin-susceptible E. faecium.\n\nMethodsTwo datasets of clinical E. faecium MALDI-TOF spectra and their resistance phenotype were analysed: our own Technical University of Munich (TUM) dataset and the publicly available MS-UMG dataset. We tested logistic regression (LR) and LightGBM models on each dataset via nested cross-validation and explored transferability on the respective other dataset.\n\nResultsLightGBM demonstrated slightly better performance than LR in identifying susceptible isolates in the TUM dataset (area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) 0.907 {+/-} 0.016 vs 0.902 {+/-} 0.030) as well as in the MS-UMG dataset (AUPRC 0.902 {+/-} 0.029 vs 0.899 {+/-} 0.054). External validation demonstrated good model transferability (AUPRC of 0.784 {+/-} 0.039 when trained on MS-UMG; 0.804 {+/-} 0.013 when trained on TUM). SHAP analysis consistently identified a top-ranked spectral feature corresponding to a peak at an m/z of 5091 in resistant isolate spectra.\n\nConclusionThis study demonstrates that LR and LightGBM models can identify ampicillin-susceptible E. faecium isolates from MALDI-TOF spectra and generalise well to unseen datasets.

Yet it remains a major bottleneck, as the current gold standard relies on manual counting by multiple blinded observers. This process is slow, labor-intensive, and prone to variability. While some software can measure total neurite length, they arent made to specifically measure new growth in complicated images from real-life injury models, like the thoracic crush and pyramidotomy model. Existing software can measure total neurite length in culture, but it is not designed to capture new growth in complex images from injury models, such as thoracic crush or pyramidotomy. Crucially, these tools lack the ability to selectively analyze growth within user-defined regions, a key requirement for injury paradigms. To address this need, we developed the Deep Neurite Analysis Tool (DeNAT), an accessible deep-learning-based platform that automatically measures neurite outgrowth after injury. DeNAT allows users to define regions of interest to specifically quantify sprouting in images from common spinal cord injury paradigms. We benchmarked its performance against manual scoring and conventional automated approaches. DeNAT achieved 87 percent accuracy in detecting neurite sprouts relative to manual counts, while reducing variability and labor. By combining user-guided region selection with automated deep learning analysis, DeNAT offers an accurate, reproducible, and efficient solution for measuring neurite outgrowth in injury models.",

While naturally occurring consortia or single strains often fall short in efficiency, synthetic microbial communities (SynComs) hold greater promise for enhanced degradation. To address this challenge, we developed GENIA (Genomically and Environmentally Networked Intelligent Assemblies), a genome-informed and machine learning-guided framework for the rational design of SynComs capable of multi-pollutant degradation under simulated environmental conditions. Using a microfluidic high-throughput cultivation platform, 2,155 bacterial strains were isolated from xenobiotic-enriched environments and screened for pollutant-specific growth. Whole-genome sequencing and functional annotation of 45 prioritized strains revealed metabolic traits associated with the potential degradation of challenging persistent environmental pollutants as proof of concept, i.e., lignin oxidation, atrazine dechlorination, and PFAS defluorination. These genomic profiles were encoded into spline-based graph representations and integrated within the GENIA pipeline, which combines graph neural networks, pathway complementarity modeling, and functional redundancy minimization to predict optimal community assemblies. The resulting nine-member community--comprising Pantoea dispersa, Atlantibacter hermannii, Pseudomonas fulva, Paenibacillus polymyxa, Bacillus cabrialesii, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus pseudomycoides, Bacillus licheniformis, and Pseudomonas pergaminensis--was predicted to exhibit broad catabolic capacity and minimal intra-community competition. Kinetic experiments in minimal medium demonstrated simultaneous multi-pollutant degradation: lignin (91.6% removal by day 5), atrazine (91.4% removal by day 3), and PFOS (93.1% removal within seven days), representing a 2-4-fold improvement over existing approaches.

While most research has focused on the gut microbiome, limited data address the role of the oral microbiome in T1D. The oral and gut microbiomes overlap substantially, and the oral cavity may influence the gut microbial composition. Saliva and dental plaque represent two distinct oral niches with unique microbial communities, but it remains unclear which better reflects systemic disease states such as T1D. This study compared the performance of salivary and plaque microbiomes in classifying pediatric T1D status.\n\nMethodsPaired saliva and plaque samples were collected from 46 children (23 with T1D and 23 healthy controls). Microbial DNA was extracted and sequenced to target the 16S rRNA gene. The data were processed via QIIME 2 for taxonomic classification and centered log-ratio transformation. Alpha diversity, microbial abundance, and clustering analyses were performed to compare the oral microbiome between the T1D and control groups. Random forest classifiers were used to evaluate and compare the predictive accuracy of saliva- and plaque-based models, both with and without clinical metadata.\n\nResultsSaliva samples presented lower alpha diversity than plaque samples did but presented significantly greater bacterial loads and total microbial abundances. Saliva-based models outperformed plaque-based models, achieving a classification accuracy of 94.2% with or without clinical metadata, compared with 73.3% accuracy for plaque-based models. ROC curve analysis further supported this difference, with saliva models reaching an AUC of approximately 0.94 versus 0.75 for plaque, indicating superior discriminative performance. UMAP clustering revealed more distinct separation of the T1D and control groups in terms of the salivary profiles than in the plaque profiles. Feature importance analysis revealed both unique and shared taxa predictive of T1D in each niche. The incorporation of clinical and demographic metadata did not enhance model performance, underscoring the robustness and predictive strength of microbiome data alone.\n\nConclusionThe salivary microbiome is a more effective biospecimen than dental plaque for detecting T1D-associated microbial profiles in children. It offers superior classification accuracy and greater sensitivity in distinguishing T1D status, supporting salivas potential as a noninvasive, scalable medium for future microbiome-based monitoring.",

Across datasets and timepoints (12 to 24 hpi), Random forests accurately distinguished cells infected with different viruses. Controls with label permutation and read shuffling across experimental conditions established non-random performance. Influenza A infections exhibited the strongest, most distinct signatures, whereas Ebola and Lassa virus responses were subtler yet still classifiable.

Here, we present the first detailed molecular map of the brain lipidome across 123 brain regions, using MSI combined with trustworthy visualizations and 191 polygon annotations. Leveraging recent advances in MSI visualization, such as MSI-VISUAL, we mapped the annotations to anatomically and molecularly defined brain regions directly from the MSI data alone, without relying on external imaging modalities. To address challenges posed by annotation ambiguities and the inherent complexity of MSI data, we developed the Computational Brain Lipid Atlas (CBLA) -- a novel graph-based visual explainability method that provides virtual landscapes of molecular lipid compositions across brain regions and functional subdivisions. CBLA serves a broader role beyond annotation refinement: it utilizes dimensionality reduction and ensembles of supervised machine learning models to enable interpretable exploration of the molecular data, clarifies relationships between annotations, explains the behavior of trained machine learning models, and facilitates the generation of biological hypotheses about functional organization and molecular linkages. Using CBLA, we uncovered new patterns of lipid distribution, functional integration, anatomical connectivity, and location-specific disease-associated molecular signatures. Through novel computational decomposition of annotated regions into m/z features, we performed large-scale, high-resolution mapping of the brain lipidome, further enhanced by a novel method for resolving full-precision m/z values from binned MSI data. This mapping may be used as a starting point for further research on the brain lipidome. We demonstrate its usage for multiple biological insights, including the molecular composition of A{beta} plaques, their spatial distribution, and their relationship with other brain regions.",

        "abstract": "Avian influenza remains a serious risk to human health via zoonotic transmission, as well as a feasible pandemic threat. Although limited zoonotic cases have resulted from the current epizootic outbreak, the wide diversity of influenza viruses in avian hosts means the emergence of new strains that could transmit to humans more readily cannot be ruled out. There is therefore a need to anticipate zoonotic potential before spillover occurs.\n\nHere, we develop a novel zoonotic prediction model for avian influenza viruses, building upon \"host-predictor\" machine learning methods that estimate host potential given only a viral genome sequence. We construct a machine learning framework combining individual sub-models of influenza genome segments, each trained on many genomic and proteomic traits (e.g., k-mer composition, codon biases, protein physicochemistry).\n\nTo prevent over-fitting to heavily sampled lineages and ensure models generalise to phylogenetically distant viruses, we pre-process training data by considering clusters of shared sequence identity. Curated training sets cover [~]4,000 representative, complete genome sequences of avian influenza from 120 subtypes including 9 containing known zoonotic viruses.\n\nWe combine best-performing models into a single ensemble that can distinguish zoonotic capability of sequences held out from training with strong performance (AUROC = 0.95, F1 score = 0.90), including sequences of rarely-sampled subtypes, e.g., H10N8. Interrogating ensemble model decisions also allows us to identify influential genomic motifs most associated with human infection.\n\nThese findings suggest specific genomic traits that are key to understanding and monitoring evolution of influenza viruses that circulate within bird populations. Our ensemble model can estimate zoonotic potential for new sequence inputs, offering a means to quickly risk-assess emerging avian influenza strains as soon as a sequence becomes available.",

However, due to their small size, the reconstruction of the full vesicle endowment across an entire neuronal morphology remains challenging. To achieve this, we have used, as a tool to identify and visualize vesicles, Volume Electron Microscopy (vEM), a method that has the nanoscale resolution to detect individual vesicle boundaries, content, and 3D locations. However, the large volume of vEM datasets poses a challenge in the segmentation, classification, and spatial analysis of tens of thousands of vesicles and their target cell in 3D. Here we report the development of VesiclePy, an integrated pipeline for automated segmentation, classification, proofreading, and spatial analysis of vesicles, relative to neuron masks in large-volume electron microscopy data. Our package integrates the efficiency of deep learning and the accuracy of human proofreading and provides a streamlined package in chunked processing and accurate indexing, localization, and visualization of single vesicle resolution in large vEM data. We demonstrate the viability of VesiclePy using high-pressure frozen serial EM data of Hydra vulgaris and quantify the performance of the package using ground truth manual annotations. We show that VesiclePy can process a multiterabyte serial EM dataset, efficiently annotate 53,851 vesicles from 20 complete neurons, and classify vesicles into 5 types. Each vesicle has a unique ID and 3D location for further spatial analysis in relation to neuron or non-neuronal targets nearby. Finally, by combining vesicle data and morphological information of each neuron, we can quantitatively cluster neurons into subtypes.

Alterations to the three-dimensional (3D) spatial interactions among gene regulatory elements are increasingly recognized as a mechanism by which genetic variants influence gene expression. However, experimentally evaluating whether variants disrupt 3D-genome structure is not feasible at GWAS scale. To address this, we developed a computational framework that integrates GWAS summary statistics with predictions from the Akita sequence-based deep learning model of 3D chromatin contacts. We applied the framework to 9,917 genomic regions associated with human height, assessing both individual variants and haplotypes for their predicted impact on 3D genome architecture. Only a small fraction of height-associated haplotypes had substantial predicted disruption of 3D folding (17 regions, 0.17%, exceeded a disruption score of 0.1). Considering all common variants in a haplotype together generally produced greater perturbations than individual variants, but several highly divergent regions were driven by single variants. We highlight a variant that disrupts the binding motif at a confirmed CTCF binding site and is predicted to modify 3D genome contacts with the LCOR promoter, suggesting that 3D-genome-mediated disruption of gene regulation underlies the association with height. This work presents a scalable and interpretable strategy for integrating 3D genome modeling with GWAS, enabling investigation of this important regulatory mechanism in the connection of non-coding genetic variation to complex traits.",

SC-LSS first localizes the boundaries of SC and subsequently determines the boundaries of SC within the localized region. We used 324 B-scans from 16 mouse eyes for training, validation, and testing the model, and 203 additional B-scans from 16 mouse eyes to evaluate the models accuracy. We found that the Dice coefficient between segmentations generated by SC-LSS and manual expert graders was 0.70 {+/-} 0.20 and that the Dice coefficient between two expert graders was 0.73 {+/-} 0.18 (p = 0.10). Furthermore, SC-LSS captured decreases in SC size with increasing intraocular pressure, yielding a 51.5% decrease in SC size at 20 mmHg compared to 5 mmHg. SC-LSS also identified a 20.1% increase in SC size following the administration of pilocarpine.

Mining these data holds significant potential for enhancing disease diagnosis and prognosis, though challenges remain, especially in non-cancer contexts. In this study, we developed a statistical framework that links raw histological images and their derived features to the genotype, transcriptome, and chronological age of the samples. We first demonstrated an association between image features and genotypes, identifying 906 image quantitative trait loci (imageQTLs) significantly associated with image features. Next, we identified differentially expressed (DE) genes by stratifying samples into image-similar groups based on image features and performing DE comparisons between groups. Additionally, we developed a deep-learning model that accurately predicts gene expression in specific tissues from raw images and their features, highlighting gene sets associated with observed morphological changes. Finally, we constructed another deep-learning model to predict chronological age directly from raw images and their features, revealing relationships between age and tissue morphology, especially aspects derived from nucleus features. Both models are supported by a computational approach that greatly compresses gigapixel whole-slide images and extracts interpretable nucleus features, integrating both large-scale tissue morphology and smaller local structures. We have made all interpretable nucleus features, imageQTLs, DE genes, and deep-learning models available as online resources for further research.\n\nSignificance StatementThis study establishes a comprehensive framework that links histological image features to genotype, transcriptome, and chronological age in large-scale healthy tissue datasets, providing valuable insights into tissue morphology. By identifying 906 significant, interpretable imageQTLs and conducting differential expression analysis based on image features, we enhance understanding of genetic and morphological interactions.

Beyond their classical role in energy production, they dynamically coordinate processes like pyrimidine biosynthesis and heme metabolism, adapting their functions across the intra-erythrocytic development cycle (IDC). Their unique architecture and stage-specific roles enable the parasite to fine-tune mitochondrial gene expression, involving both protein-coding sense transcripts and long non-coding natural antisense transcripts (NATs). This study unveils an unprecedented regulatory complexity by integrating transcriptomic profiling with advanced machine learning to decode the role of mitochondrial sense and natural antisense transcripts (NATs) in severe P. vivax malaria. We reveal distinct, clinically relevant expression signatures, where NATs emerge not as transcriptional by-products but as potent regulators tightly linked to mitochondrial pathways and translational machinery. This dual-layered transcriptomic landscape reflects an intricate molecular strategy by which the parasite fine-tunes mitochondrial function to survive under severe disease conditions. Importantly, while these findings illuminate novel regulatory mechanisms and position mitochondrial NATs as promising targets for antimalarial drug development, they represent preliminary insights derived from a limited clinical cohort and should not be interpreted as definitive clinical indicators. Validation in larger and diverse patient populations is essential to confirm their broader biological and clinical relevance.

Although digestibility and fermentation profiles differ by protein type, a systematic evaluation of how these differences shape microbial diversity, structure, and metabolic capacity is still lacking. This meta-analysis integrates machine learning and functional inference to identify microbial biomarkers and metabolic signatures associated with dietary protein source in murine models\n\nMethodsFollowing PRISMA guidelines, we analyzed 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from 10 murine studies (n = 187) comparing animal and plant protein diets. Alpha diversity was assessed using multiple indices, including Shannon, Inverse Simpson, and Chao1, to capture richness and evenness across samples. Beta diversity was evaluated using Aitchison distances. LEfSe and class-weighted Random Forest models were applied to identify differentially abundant taxa and predictive microbial features. Functional potential was inferred using PICRUSt2, and taxon-pathway relationships were explored through correlation and network analysis.\n\nResultsPlant-protein diets significantly increased gut microbial diversity across all assessed alpha diversity metrics: Chao1 (p = 5.7 x 10 {square}{superscript 1}{square}), Shannon (p = 3.3 x 10{square}{square}), and Inverse Simpson (p = 0.0013), reflecting enhanced species richness and evenness. These diets are associated with increased richness of 33 genera, including Bacteroides, Muribaculaceae, and Allobaculum, associated with SCFA production, nitrogen recycling, and bile acid metabolism. In contrast, animal-protein diets favored taxa such as Clostridium sensu stricto 1 and Colidextribacter, linked to proteolytic fermentation, ammonia, and sulfur metabolism. PCA of Aitchison distances revealed distinct microbial community structures between groups (ANOSIM R = 0.663, p < 0.001). Random Forest models achieved >88% accuracy (AUC = 0.995) in predicting dietary groups based on microbial composition. LEfSe confirmed key taxa distinguishing the dietary groups. Functional profiling revealed that plant-based diets enriched pathways for short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production and aromatic amino acid degradation, while animal-based diets favored pathways involved in sulfur metabolism and branched-chain amino acid degradation. Network analysis identified Muribaculaceae as a central hub in plant-associated subnetworks linked to carbohydrate and SCFA metabolism, whereas Lactobacillus dominated animal-associated subnetworks enriched for proteolysis and sulfur-related functions. However, variation in dietary fat and fiber across studies may partially contribute to these microbial patterns, as these covariates were not consistently reported and therefore not included in the model.\n\nConclusionDietary protein source significantly influences gut microbiota composition and function in murine models. This study identifies distinct taxonomic and functional signatures associated with plant and animal protein diets, with implications for microbial nitrogen utilization, sulfur metabolism, host-microbe interactions, and dietary modulation strategies. However, because other diet components, such as fat and fiber content, varied across studies and were not consistently reported, we could not include them as covariates. This represents a limitation in isolating protein-specific effects. Future studies should use controlled designs with matched non-protein components to address this gap",

However, the acoustic environment of a site can significantly impact the detectability of species using such models, potentially leading to biased estimates of species abundance and distribution. This impact is poorly understood, and current manual validation methods for assessing acoustic detectability are intractable when working with many species, across multiple locations and datasets, due to the intensive time requirements to manually identify false negatives.\nC_LIO_LIWe introduce a new method, Noise-Augmented Detectability Estimation (NADE), to estimate the impact of site-specific environmental noise on the acoustic detectability of different species. We use vocalisations augmented with noise from the sites themselves to alleviate the need for manual validation of detectability. Our approach produces site- and species-specific estimates of the complex relationship between background noise, vocalisation amplitude, and acoustic detectability when using a machine learning detection model. We evaluate this method using BirdNET on six bird species, in the UK, demonstrating its potential for broader application in acoustic ecology.\nC_LIO_LIOur results show that there are large differences in the ability of a machine learning model to detect and classify vocalisations across different sites and species. For example: the detectability of loud vocalisations can be 90% at one site and 10% at another; the detectability at a site can be halved during the course of a survey; and that the amplitude of the background noise alone is insufficient to correctly estimate the detectability of a vocalisation. Detectability at a site can also vary considerably by species: a site can have the relatively high detectability for one species but poorer detectability for another.\nC_LIO_LIBy providing a quantitative measure of how site-specific background noise affects acoustic detectability, NADE could be used to improve the accuracy of species abundance estimates derived from passive acoustic monitoring, helping to identify sites and times where the detectability is likely to be lower. This approach provides a significant step towards making acoustic detectability estimation more feasible, allowing more robust estimates of species abundance and distribution from acoustic data.\nC_LI",

Although immune tolerance at the maternal-fetal interface is critical for successful pregnancy, the immune disruptions that contribute to RPL, independent of fetal aneuploidy, remain poorly characterized.\n\nMethodsWe performed single-cell RNA sequencing of decidual tissues from RPL patients and gestational age-matched controls. We employed single-cell transcriptomics coupled with genotype-based origin analysis to dissect immune dysregulation in RPL. To identify cell type-specific RPL signatures, we mutually applied a supervised machine learning model and foundation model-based analysis, followed by pathway enrichment and network analysis. In addition, we prioritized drug repurposing candidates based on the drug response data, which reversed the RPL-associated transcriptional profiles.\n\nResultsIn normal pregnancy, fetal immune cells were nearly absent but increased in RPL, whereas fetal trophoblasts were reduced, suggesting hindered placental development despite the absence of chromosomal abnormalities in fetal cells. Interestingly, by showing a strong common rejection module score, RPL immune cells resemble the transcriptional signatures of acute transplant rejection, indicating the contribution of the maternal immune system. Our machine learning and transformer-based models mutually identified T-cell-derived transcriptomic signatures that distinguished RPL immune cells. By examining biological confounding factors, including fetal-origin signatures, we prioritized CXCR4 and JUN in maternal T cells as RPL-associated signatures.

Understanding of the fusion protein conformational stability, rapid and accurate identification of the stabilizing interactions are critically important for inhibiting the infections. Here, we leverage molecular dynamics simulations, novel machine learning models and biological experiments to identify the crucial interactions dictating the structural stability of glycoprotein B (gB), a class III fusion protein. We focused on the interactions between the fusion loops and the membrane proximal region in gB, and a new Q181-R747 polar interaction was identified from our machine learning model as critical in stabilizing the gB pre-fusion conformation. Molecular simulations revealed that mutation of Q181 with proline (Q181P) disrupted the fusion loop secondary structure and reduced gB pre-fusion stability. Experiments were designed to evaluate the impact of the Q181P on fusion. Strikingly, the mutation completely abrogated gB membrane fusion activity. The experiments confirmed the importance of Q181-R747 interaction on fusion, which is consistent with the model predictions. The results deepen our fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms of gB during viral fusion, which may lead to novel antiviral interventions. The modeling and experimental framework can be generalized to rapidly identify the critical inter-molecular interactions in other important biological processes.",

        "abstract": "Transcranial focused ultrasound is an emerging noninvasive neuromodulation technique that offers high spatial precision and the potential for deep brain penetration. However, due to skull-induced attenuation and acoustic aberrations, precisely stimulating deep brain regions in mice remains challenging. To address this challenge, this study introduces a machine-learning-based computational framework to optimize single-element transducer designs for accurate deep-brain targeting in a mouse model. This framework includes a surrogate model consisting of a Random Forest regressor and classifier, trained on acoustic simulation results to predict performance from design parameters. A total of 72 transducer designs were simulated across coronal and sagittal planes, systematically varying frequency (1-6 MHz), radius of curvature (5-7 mm), and f-number (0.58-1.0). Each design was evaluated using five performance metrics: focal length, focal shape, maximum pressure at the focal region, pressure maximum location, and sidelobe suppression. The surrogate models were then combined with the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to perform multi-objective optimization and identify high-performing transducer designs. The optimized design produced a compact, symmetric focal region and accurate energy delivery to deep targets, with minimal off-target exposure, even in complex skull anatomy. Results show that lower f-numbers, moderate radius of curvature, and higher frequencies facilitate precise deep brain targeting. Overall, this data-driven approach enables practical design of single-element transducers for deep-brain neuromodulation in mice and provides a framework for designing transcranial transducers for other brain targets, potentially accelerating the clinical translation of focused ultrasound technologies.",

SnakeClassifier trained on 50 genes accurately predicted T2D at single cell resolution, outperforming classical ensemble machine learning classifier models, and yielded donor level diabetes scores that correlated with chronic hyperglycemia. The clustering of {beta} cell populations ({beta}1-4) revealed a resilient non-diabetic (ND) {beta}1 subtype characterized by preserved {beta} cell identity genes and lower disease risk, whereas T2D {beta}2-4 subtypes exhibited upregulation of genes involved in cellular and mitochondrial stress and suppression of genes promoting oxidative phosphorylation and insulin secretion. Mitophagy emerged as the dominant program linked to T2D and a mitophagy focused BlackSwanClassifier nominated PINK1, BNIP3, and FUNDC1 as key regulators. PINK1 was enriched in ND {beta}1, decreased with T2D disease score and connected sex stratified mitophagy. We generated a KANN derived mitochondrial fitness index (MFI) integrating mitophagy, mitochondrial proteostasis, biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation into a single interpretable score (R2 = 0.934 vs module-based mitochondria quality index), which identified mitophagy PINK1, SQSTM1, PRKN and BNIP3 as top contributors to T2D progression. These transparent models unify prediction with T2D disease mechanism and identify the mitophagy receptor PINK1 as a central determinant of {beta} cell metabolic fitness",

Regulatory regions show cell type-specific epigenome activity and differ in their location, size, and distance to their target genes, complicating discovery and analysis. Recent machine learning models have been proposed to address these problems by learning functions for the prediction of gene expression from epigenomic data. Here, we use the large IHEC EpiATLAS dataset to benchmark state-of-the-art linear and non-linear approaches. Each approach is optimized for over 28,000 human genes, providing a comprehensive regulatory catalog of gene models. In-depth comparison reveals that gene characteristics and the epigenomic complexity of the locus influence the difficulty of predicting the epigenome-to-transcriptome association. The model performance is further evaluated using CRISPRi and eQTL validation data. Based on these models, we conduct histone-acetylation association studies in a systematic way to investigate how epigenomic variation impacts gene expression. The model-based analysis revealed genes and regulatory regions linked to B-cell leukemia in patient data with known disease-related functions.

        "abstract": "Computational chemistry has entered a new era where machine learning (ML) models—particularly graph neural networks and machine learning force fields—routinely deliver quantum mechanical accuracy at classical speeds, scaling to millions of atoms and reshaping workflows in drug discovery, catalysis, and materials design. At the same time, quantum computing is promoted as chemistry’s “killer application,” with the promise of solving many body problems beyond classical reach. Between these poles lies quantum machine learning (QML), a rapidly developing field that integrates quantum algorithms with ML paradigms. But is QML today a revolution, or merely hype?\nThis article surveys the current state of classical ML in computational chemistry, highlighting its extraordinary successes and real limitations of transferability, interpretability, and generalization. We then examine the current landscape of quantum computing hardware and algorithms, clarifying what has actually been achieved with NISQ devices and where fundamental roadblocks remain. Building from this foundation, we analyze the foundations of QML algorithms—quantum kernels, variational quantum circuits, and hybrid workflows—and their putative advantages in polynomial scaling and Hilbert space expressivity.\nTo ground discussion in practice, we present a case study of H₂ molecular energies, contrasting classical ML’s near instantaneous accuracy with quantum algorithms like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver. The outcome is telling: performance parity, not advantage, achieved only for toy systems under heavy simplification. This provides proof of principle for QML’s viability while simultaneously underscoring the severe constraints of current hardware.\nFrom this synthesis, we conclude that QML is presently characterized more by hype than utility, given the industrial dominance of classical ML. Yet in the long term—likely the mid 2030s and beyond—fault tolerant quantum hardware could transform computational chemistry, especially for strongly correlated systems where classical surrogates fail. The future lies not in premature claims, but in hybrid strategies, honest benchmarks, interpretable models, and sustainable integration across classical ML and quantum approaches.\nQML is not today’s solution. It is tomorrow’s horizon. And whether it becomes a true game changer will depend not on marketing cycles, but on the community’s ability to bridge hype with the patient, long term engineering of methods and machines.\n\n",

Here, we separate the total uncertainty into contributions from noise in the data (aleatoric) and shortcomings of the model (epistemic), further dividing epistemic uncertainty into model bias and variance contributions. We systematically address the influence of noise, model bias, and model variance in the context of chemical property predictions, where the diverse nature of target properties and the vast chemical chemical space give rise to many different distinct sources of prediction error. We demonstrate that different sources of error can each be significant in different contexts and must be individually addressed during model development. Through controlled experiments on datasets of molecular properties, we show important trends in model performance associated with the level of noise in the dataset, size of the dataset, model architecture, molecule representation, ensemble size, and dataset splitting. In particular, we show that 1) noise in the test set can limit a model's observed performance when the actual performance is much better, 2) using size-extensive model aggregation structures is crucial for extensive property prediction, and 3) ensembling is a reliable tool for uncertainty quantification and improvement specifically for the contribution of model variance.

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has become a powerful tool in polymer science, with its success strongly relying on effective structural representations of polymers. While the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) is widely used due to its simplicity, it was originally designed for small molecules and struggles to capture the stochastic nature of polymers. Recently, BigSMILES has been introduced as a more compact and versatile representation of polymer structures. However, the relative performance of SMILES and BigSMILES in polymer ML tasks remains unexplored.\nIn this study, we systematically evaluate SMILES and BigSMILES across 12 polymer-related tasks, including property prediction and inverse design, utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and large language models (LLMs).  Our results show that BigSMILES enables faster training times due to its reduced token complexity, and achieves comparable or superior performance to SMILES in certain predictive tasks. Moreover, BigSMILES more accurately encodes chemical information and monomer connectivity for copolymers within LLM frameworks. This work serves as a starting point for a comprehensive evaluation of SMILES and BigSMILES in polymer ML applications, highlighting the potential of BigSMILES to streamline and accelerate polymer informatics workflows, particularly for complex systems like copolymers and polymer composites. Looking ahead, advancing polymer representations to integrate polymer chain structure, phase morphology, and processing parameters will be crucial for capturing the multifaceted relationships between polymer structure and properties, driving more accurate and efficient modeling.",

        "abstract": "Solving optimization problems, especially for nonlinear and constrained systems, is a challenge. Decades of specialized algorithms have been developed for general and special cases of root ﬁnding, minimization (including constraints), for parameter estimation, and mapping connected spaces. These approaches typically require a model, or set of equations, and then analytical, or iterative numerical approaches can be used to ﬁnd a solution, and in some special cases a globally best solution can be found and proven. In this work we present an alternative approach to solving these problems that is based in generative machine learning models. The idea is these models either estimate a joint probability distribution of input and output variables, or are able to transform a distribution of inputs to a distribution of outputs (or vice versa). Then, by suitable conditioning (specifying desired properties of some variables), the solutions to these problems can be obtained by sampling the distribution, or by transformation of a distribution sample to the solution space. We illustrate the approach with Gaussian mixture models, which approximate the joint probability distribution. We show examples in root ﬁnding, unconstrained and constrained optimization, parameter estimation and mapping input and output spaces. This work is intended to be pedagogical to show how a generative model can be used to solve problems in optimization. We discuss some limitations of this approach, but conclude the approach has promise and is diﬀerent than existing approaches.",

Community benchmarks and leaderboard rankings are frequently updated, providing statistical insights into overall progress. However, the allure of using top performing uMLIPs from these leaderboards blindly to real world applications can result in unreliable predictions if their limitations and caveats are not well understood. Fine tuning an uMLIP or constructing a MLIP based on active learning are often necessary to get reasonable predictions on real-world datasets. The machine-learned interatomic potential eXploration (MLIPX) ecosystem adopts a user-centric perspective to address the question: Among the given list of MLIPs, which one should I choose for my specific application? and re-evaluate it seamlessly as soon as a new MLIP arrives. MLIPX achieves this through a framework of reusable recipes for a variety of simulation tasks, automated data versioning, and integrated comparative visualization tools. This significantly reduces the overhead of setting up and analyzing results from multiple MLIPs. We present example application cases to compare different lead- ing uMLIP, showcasing the utility of MLIPX. The MLIPX software enables users to build and share recipes for application-specific test sets, featuring powerful and interactive comparison tools via the ZnDraw web interface. Furthermore, we introduce the MLIPX-hub, fostering community engagement for the continuous development of new test cases.

Since it is expensive to propagate the configuration probabilities of the entire lattice, it is practical to consider the occupation probabilities of a typical site or a cluster of sites instead. This amounts to a moment closure approximation of the chemical master equation (CME). Unfortunately, simple closures, such as the mean-field (MF) and the pair approximation (PA), exhibit weaknesses in systems with significant long-range correlation. In this paper, we show that machine learning (ML) can be used to construct accurate moment closures in chemical kinetics, using the lattice Lotka-Volterra model (LLVM) as a model system. We trained feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) on kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) results at select values of rate constants and initial conditions. Given the same level of input as PA, the machine learning moment closure (MLMC) gave accurate predictions of the instantaneous three-site occupation probabilities. Solving the kinetic equations in conjunction with MLMC gave drastic improvements in the simulated dynamics and descriptions of the dynamical regimes throughout the parameter space. In this way, MLMC is a promising tool to interpolate KMC simulations or construct pre-trained closures that would enable researchers to extract useful insight at a fraction of the computational cost.",

With recent improvements on the achievable accuracies, the focus has now shifted on the dataset composition itself. The reliable identification of erroneously predicted configurations to extend a given dataset is therefore of high priority. Yet, uncertainty estimation techniques have achieved mixed results for machine learning potentials. Consequently, a general and versatile method to correlate energy or atomic force uncertainties with the model error has remained elusive to date. In the current work, we show that epistemic uncertainty cannot correlate with model error by definition, but can be aggregated over groups of atoms to yield a strong correlation. We demonstrate that our method correctly estimates prediction errors both globally per structure, and locally resolved per atom. The direct correlation of local uncertainty and local error is used to design an active learning framework based on identifying local sub-regions of a large simulation cell, and performing ab-initio calculations only for the sub-region subsequently.

        "abstract": "Here, we develop machine learning (ML) models to predict catalytic performance in rhodium-catalyzed propene hydroformylation and identify new ligands and reaction conditions for enhanced yield and selectivity. A curated dataset of 215 experimentally obtained data points involving [Rh(acac)(CO)₂] precatalyst and 49 phosphine ligands was used. Molecular, electronic, and reaction descriptors were constructed using cheminformatic representations and dimensionality reduction. Among several algorithms tested, XGBoost exhibited the best performance, achieving a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 9.85% for iso-selectivity under leave-one-ligand-out cross-validation. Feature importance analysis revealed that ligand and solvent descriptors most strongly influence selectivity, whereas turnover number (TON) predictions were more challenging. A bootstrapped ensemble of XGBoost models integrated with a genetic algorithm enabled the exploration of vast ligand–condition space, yielding 58 candidate ligands predicted to achieve TON ≥ 330 and Iso(%) ≥ 70. This study demonstrates that interpretable ML models can complement mechanistic understanding and accelerate catalyst design for small-alkene hydroformylation.",

This study aims to investigate the influence of machine learning algorithms and the number of initial data points on reaction yield prediction for two public high-throughput experimentation datasets. Our results show that active learning based on output margin reached a pre-defined accuracy (AUROC) faster than using passive learning.

A random forest algorithm was trained using a highly reproducible, concise dataset to accurately predict the stereoselective outcome of glycosylations. The steric and electronic contributions of all chemical reagents and solvents were quantified by quantum mechanical calculations. The trained model accurately predicts stereoselectivities for unseen nucleophiles, electrophiles, acid catalyst, and solvents across a wide temperature range (overall root mean square error 6.8%). All predictions were validated experimentally on a standardized microreactor platform. The model helped to identify novel ways to control glycosylation stereoselectivity and accurately predicts previously unknown means of stereocontrol. By quantifying the degree of influence of each variable, we discovered that environmental factors influence the stereoselectivity of glycosylations more than the coupling partners in this area of chemical space. <br />",

Recently, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as a promising alternative to DFT, offering near-DFT accuracy at significantly reduced cost. In this perspective, we discuss the application of MLIPs in heterogeneous catalyst modeling as a surrogate for DFT. We detail how MLIPs have been applied in thermal catalysis to probe active sites, enable studying complex metallic and nanoporous catalysts, and investigate the reconstruction of catalytic surfaces. We review the use of MLIPs in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, emphasizing their capabilities in studying transition metal oxide surfaces and solid-liquid interfaces. We also discuss the current limitations of MLIPs, particularly their challenges with transferability and description of non-local interactions. Finally, we conclude by identifying promising and underexplored domains in which MLIPs can further advance our understanding of heterogeneous catalysts.",

Training sets used to develop transferable potentials are very large, typically millions of examples, and as such, are restricted to relatively inexpensive levels of ab initio theory, such as density functional theory in a double- or triple-zeta quality basis set, which are subject to significant errors. It has been previously demonstrated using transfer learning that a model trained on a large dataset of such inexpensive calculations can be re-trained to reproduce energies of a higher level of theory using a much smaller dataset. Here, we show that more generally, one can use hard parameter sharing to successfully train to multiple levels of theory simultaneously. We demonstrate that simultaneously training to two levels of theory is an alternative to freezing layers in a neural network and re-training. Further, we show that training multiple levels of theory can improve the overall performance of all predictions and that one can transfer knowledge about a chemical domain present in only one of the datasets to all predicted levels of theory. This methodology is one way in which multiple, incompatible datasets can be combined to train a transferable model, increasing the accuracy and domain of applicability of machine learning force fields.

However, activity cliffs – pairs of molecules that are highly similar in their structure but exhibit large differences in potency – have been underinvestigated for their effect on model performance. Not only are these edge cases informative for molecule discovery and optimization, but models that are well-equipped to accurately predict the potency of activity cliffs have an increased potential for prospective applications. Our work aims to fill the current knowledge gap on best-practice machine learning methods in the presence of activity cliffs. We benchmarked a total of 720 machine and deep learning models on curated bioactivity data from 30 macromolecular targets for their performance on activity cliff compounds. While all methods struggled in the presence of activity cliffs, machine learning approaches based on molecular descriptors outperformed more complex deep learning methods. Our findings highlight large case-by-case differences in performance, advocating for (a) the inclusion of dedicated “activity-cliff-centered” metrics during model development and evaluation, and (b) the development of novel algorithms to better predict the properties of activity cliffs. To this end, the methods, metrics, and results of this study have been encapsulated into an open-access benchmarking platform named MoleculeACE (Activity Cliff Estimation, available on GitHub at: https://github.com/molML/MoleculeACE).

In this work, we studied the possibility of using machine learning-trained algorithms in order to calculate the thermal properties of siliceous zeolite frameworks. We used as training data the thermal properties of 120 zeolites, calculated at the DFT level, in the quasi-harmonic approximation. We compared the statistical accuracy of trained models (based on the gradient boosting regression technique) using different types of descriptors, including ad hoc geometrical features, topology, pore space, and general geometric descriptors. While geometric descriptors were found to perform best, we also identified limitations on the accuracy of the predictions, especially for a small group of materials with very highly negative thermal expansion coefficients. We then studied the generalizability of the technique, demonstrating that the predictions were not sensitive to the refinement of framework structures at a high level of theory. Therefore, the models are suitable for the exploration and screening of large-scale databases of hypothetical frameworks, which we illustrate on the PCOD2 database of zeolites containing around 600,000 hypothetical structures.",

This perspective describes the characteristics of deductive reasoning that are helpful for understanding the role played by expert intervention in problem-solving and why such interventions are often relatively resistant to disruption by typical machine learning strategies. The perspective then covers what factors contribute to creating a deductive bottleneck, how deductive bottlenecks are currently addressed in several application areas, and how machine learning models capable of deduction can be designed.

Significant protein expression differences were observed between amyloid positive (n=337) and amyloid negative (n=651) groups. Classification models reached balanced performance with prediction accuracy up AUC of 0.80.

In this retrospective study, we evaluated the use of a two-stage machine learning (ML) approach to predict thrombophilia diagnosis and subsequent anticoagulation treatment. The study included data (14 clinical and 26 laboratory features) from 496 patients evaluated at the University Hospital Bonn between 2019 and 2024. The hybrid nature of the diagnostic categories combining ordinal (including thrombophilia diagnosis severity and treatment recommendations) and categorical (e.g. antiphospholipid syndrome) classes necessitated a two-stage approach. XGBClassifier was used to distinguish categorical from ordinal classes, followed by an ordinal-specific XGBOrdinalV2 model. A sliding window approach improved classification performance across all ordinal categories reaching sensitivities above 89% across all ordinal classes. Feature importance analysis revealed that age at first thrombosis and antiphospholipid antibody status were key predictive variables. Of the 496 patients, 362 (73%) experienced no discrepancy between the ML-based predictions and the practitioner diagnosis and subsequent treatment recommendations. Re-evaluation of the remaining 134 patients revealed that, while the ML models correctly classified 36 patients, it underestimated or overestimated the thrombophilia severity in 71 and 27 patients, respectively. This study highlights the potential of interpretable ML models to support standardized thrombophilia management and improve diagnostic accuracy.

While screening tools like the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) are widely used, brevity is important for busy clinical practice to reduce administration time and patient burden. Current methods to shorten assessments rely on traditional psychometric approaches, rather than machine learning (ML) methods that could optimize predictive accuracy.\n\nMethodsWe developed an ML framework using National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) data to predict full 10-item EPDS scores from shortened question subsets (n=22,924). We evaluated all 2-5 item combinations using linear regression, validating performance across multiple cohorts including postpartum women (n=7,750) and external pregnancy populations (n=1,217). For additional validation, we applied our approach to the PHQ-9 (n=398,606) to test generalizability. Binary classification models using clinical thresholds ([&ge;]13) determined EPDS screening accuracy. Decision curve analysis was performed to assess the clinical utility of our ML method.\n\nResultsThe optimal 2-question EPDS combinations Q4+Q8 (anxiety/sadness) and Q5+Q8 (scared/sadness) both achieved R2=0.70. Binary classification demonstrated strong performance (sensitivity=0.68-0.72, specificity=0.98-0.99). The framework generalized across postpartum subsets, external pregnancy cohorts, and PHQ-9 validation (R2=0.64-0.73). Adding covariates did not improve performance. Decision curve analysis showed our ML approach had superior clinical benefit (0.01-0.03) versus traditional additive scoring.\n\nConclusion/ImplicationsOur ML framework suggests a reduced assessment burden with two EPDS questions maintains predictive accuracy as the full-item EPDS.

This retrospective cross-sectional study comprised 4 054 clinical isolates from 874 patient records (2022-2024). Five ML models, namely, support vector machine (SVM), random forest, logistic regression, gradient boosting, and k-nearest neighbors (KNN), were trained and evaluated, focusing on predictive performance for surveillance purposes. Among all evaluated models, SVM achieved the highest accuracy (72.08%), precision (73.25%), recall (79.78%), F1 score (0.76), and AUC-ROC (0.79), indicating it as the most effective model for AMR surveillance in this study. Feature importance analysis revealed that antibiotic class, hospital ward, patient age, and pathogen type were significant predictors of resistance. Notably, resistance was high for tetracycline (72.1%) and nitrofurantoin (75.7%), whereas imipenem (7.7%) showed the lowest resistance rates. Multidrug resistance was high among S. aureus (30%), whereas Shigella spp. and Serratia marcescens showed no multidrug resistance.

        "abstract": "Background: Aspiration causes or aggravates a variety of respiratory diseases. Subjective bedside evaluations of aspiration are limited by poor inter- and intra-rater reliability, while gold standard diagnostic tests for aspiration, such as video fluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), are cumbersome or invasive and healthcare resource intensive. Objective: To develop and validate a novel machine learning algorithm that can analyze simple vowel phonations, to aid in predicting aspiration risk. Methods: Recorded [i] phonations during routine nasal endoscopy from 163 unique patients were retrospectively analyzed for acoustic features including pitch, jitter, shimmer, harmonic to noise ratio (HNR), and others. Supervised machine learning (ML) was performed on the vowel phonations of those at high-risk for aspiration versus those at low-risk for aspiration. Ground truth of aspiration risk classification for model development was established using VFSS. The performance of the ML model was tested on an independent, external cohort of patient voice samples. The performance of trained Speech Language Pathologists (SLPs) to categorize high versus low-risk aspirators by listening to phonations was compared against the ML model. Results: Mean ML risk score for those with the ground truth of high versus low aspiration risk was 0.530+ 0.310 vs 0.243+0.249, which was a significant difference (0.287, 95% CI: 0.192-0.381) p<0.001. In the development cohort, the model showed an area under the curve (AUC) for the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) of 0.76 (0.67-0.84) with specificity of 0.76 and F1 score of 0.63. The performance of the model in an external testing cohort was comparable, with AUC of 0.70 (0.52-0.88) with a specificity of 0.81, and F1 score of 0.67. The ML model had better accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values compared to trained SLPs in classifying aspiration risk by evaluating vowel phonations. Conclusion: High risk aspirators have quantifiable voice characteristics that significantly differ from those who are at a low risk for aspiration, as detected by a ML model trained to analyze sustained phonation and tested on an independent cohort. The ML model's performance was superior to human experts in predicting aspiration risk by evaluating vowel phonations.",

        "abstract": "Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, contributing to millions of fatalities each year. Early detection and accurate risk prediction are therefore critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. In this study, seven different Machine Learning (ML) prediction models were tested on three collections of heart disease data. The data was divided, with 80% used to train the models and 20% saved to test them later. The settings for the models were carefully adjusted using a method that checks their performance multiple times to find the best ones. The models were then evaluated on the unseen test data. Their performance was measured using several metrics (Accuracy, Recall, Precision, PR-AUC and ROC-AUC), and their results were further examined using a confusion matrix. In addition to traditional evaluation metrics, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was employed to interpret the contribution of each feature to the models predictions. It was observed that the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) achieved the highest performance on both datasets, demonstrating strong predictive capability while remaining interpretable through the integration of SHAP. This study shows that modern ML models can be very good at predicting heart disease risk, and provide explainable performance. A ready-to-use method for predicting heart disease risk is provided by this study to help doctors choose the best tool.",

        "abstract": "Despite the availability of more than 20 anti-seizure medications (ASMs), approximately half of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy fail their first drug trial. Unfortunately, clinicians lack objective tools or consensus guidelines to match individual patients with the most effective therapy, frequently leading to years of uncontrolled seizures. Here, we developed machine learning models to utilize a single, baseline routine resting-state scalp EEG to forecast ASM efficacy. EEGs and treatment outcomes were drawn from 280 participants with new-onset focal epilepsy in the prospective, multicenter Human Epilepsy Project. Recordings were acquired within four months either before ASM initiation (unmedicated EEG) or after treatment onset (medicated EEG). For each recording we computed band-limited static and dynamic functional-connectivity and entropy-based matrices in consecutive time windows. We trained and tested classifiers in a nested fashion to predict future seizure freedom. Separate classifiers were trained to (i) predict levetiracetam response from unmedicated EEGs (22 responders, 32 non-responders) and from EEGs recorded on an ASM (53 responders, 31 non-responders); (ii) predict lamotrigine response from unmedicated EEGs (12 responders, 21 non-responders); and (iii) distinguish participants who ultimately proved refractory to all ASMs from unmedicated EEG (67 responders, 16 refractory) and EEGs recorded while on an ASM (34 responders, 80 refractory). Two model architectures were tested for each classifier. Performance, evaluated with nested leave-one-out cross-validation, was robust across at least one model architecture for each classifier: area under the ROC curve (AUC) 0.88 and balanced accuracy 0.85 for unmedicated levetiracetam, AUC 0.82 and balanced accuracy 0.77 for medicated levetiracetam, AUC 0.79 and balanced accuracy 0.80 for unmedicated lamotrigine, AUC 0.92 with balanced accuracy 0.87 for unmedicated refractory, and AUC 0.82 with balanced accuracy 0.75 for the medicated refractory model. These findings indicate that routine EEG harbors machine-learning-detectable signatures predictive of specific ASM efficacy, laying groundwork for precision-medicine tools that could shorten the costly trial-and-error period in epilepsy treatment.",

We benchmarked the V2D framework using simulations and real data analysis, demonstrating that it provides reliable estimates of heritability (h2) functional enrichment.

By applying the V2D framework with neural networks, we developed GWAS prioritization scores, which were extremely enriched in common variant h2 (20.6 {+/-} 0.7x for the top 1% scores), outperformed existing prioritization scores in the analysis of different GWAS datasets, were transportable to analyze gene expression and non-European datasets, and improved variant prioritization in GWAS fine-mapping studies.",

We developed a machine learning and probabilistic forecasting framework to predict Rt and daily COVID-19 cases, respectively, across South Carolina counties, with the flexibility to generalize to other infectious diseases.\n\nMethodsWe first estimated Rt using the EpiNow2 R package, which incorporates Bayesian time-series modeling and accounts for reporting delay and incubation period. These initial estimates were refined using spatial covariate-adjusted smoothing through the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA). We then generated Rt forecasts using an ensemble of linear regression, random forest, and XGBoost models. Daily case forecasts were obtained by linking Rt trajectories with historical case data via a Poisson model.\n\nResultsThis ensemble-based approach outperformed EpiNow2 across different forecast horizons (7-day, 14-day, and 21-day). In the first forecast period (November 11, 2020 - February 02, 2021), the ensemble achieved a median PA of 96.5% (IQR: 95.4% - 97.1%) for 7-day horizon Rt forecast, compared to 87.0% (IQR: 84.4% - 89.4%) from EpiNow2. In the second period (December 11, 2022 - March 04, 2023), the ensemble attained a 93.0% median PA for Rt forecast (IQR: 90.8% - 95.4%), while EpiNow2 reached 86.8% (IQR: 82.5% - 89.2%). Similar trends were observed for case forecasts, with the ensemble model demonstrating improved performance.\n\nConclusionThis study presents a flexible forecasting framework that integrates Bayesian estimation, spatial smoothing, and ensemble machine learning to improve the accuracy of COVID-19 transmission and case forecasts.

However, treatment response is heterogeneous, with some patients gaining the ability to sit and walk whilst others display less obvious changes.\n\nMethodFrom the SMA Reach UK and the Italian Telethon Network, 124 non-sitter SMA patients treated with nusinersen under 4 years were included and randomly allocated to training and testing (80/20%). Tree and regression-based machine learning for survival outcomes were compared, and oblique random forests were selected, with a testing C-Index of 0.74. The features were selected from items of the CHOP-INTEND and HINE-2 motor function assessments, respiratory and swallowing status using mutual information.\n\nFindingsSixty-two patients (50%) achieved sitting, at a median age of 2.4 years. The predicted median time-to-sitting in those requiring tube feeding at treatment initiation was 4-months later than those without, and this was the most influential factor. Specific motor function features, including the ability to kick in supine, were strongly associated with a higher likelihood of sitting.\n\nInterpretationThis work provides a framework for predicting nusinersen-response and represents the first stage in personalised counselling on treatment plans for SMA.\n\nFundingSupport for SMA Reach is provided by Biogen, Roche and Novartis, and historically NIHR BRC, SMA Trust, the MRC Translational Research Centre and MD UK.

Achievement of sitting after nusinersen treatment in SMA 1 has been linked to the age of treatment, symptom onset and general motor function severity (CHOP-INTEND and HINE-2 score), but no multivariable analysis or prediction of outcomes after treatment was found.\n\nAdded value of this studyOur study identifies key patient features that are linked to nusinersen treatment response in non-sitter SMA 1 patients. This work provides a higher level of granularity beyond previous univariate models, yielding a framework for predicting personalised patient sitting. Crucially, we highlight that bulbar impairment as a proxy for disease severity is very influential in predicting a patients likelihood of sitting, along with specific motor function abilities at baseline.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceDespite considerable evidence of efficacy, this work provides insights into the homogenous gross motor function response observed in SMA patients treated with nusinersen, which has been under researched. The results of this study provide individualised predictions of the likelihood of patients outcomes after treatment with nusinersen. Crucially, this work can inform clinicians in their discussions on treatment-response with parents and carers of babies with SMA.",

Current methods for classification and longitudinal monitoring are invasive, expensive, and often delayed, limiting timely diagnosis and management. This study reports the first application of high-dimensional salivary proteomics integrated with interpretable artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) to define a minimal protein signature for pediatric IBD classification with the goal of informing therapeutic decision-making.\n\nMethodsUnstimulated saliva from pediatric CD, UC, and IBD-U patients was analyzed using Alamar Biosciences NULISAseq Inflammation Panel 250 (250 proteins). Logistic regression with recursive feature elimination identified a minimal discriminative signature. Performance was tested in independent follow-up samples. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) quantified patient-specific protein contributions and assessed biological similarity of IBD-U to CD and UC.\n\nResultsDifferential abundance analysis between UC and CD revealed 53 significantly different proteins. ML identified a 14-protein signature comprising chemokines/cytokines (CCL1, IFNA1;IFNA13, IL12p70, IL34, TNFSF11/RANKL), receptors/ligands (CD40LG, ICOSLG, IL1R2, IL17RA), structural/tissue-remodeling proteins (CD93, GFAP, SPP1), and growth factors/immune modulators (GDF2, GZMA). The model achieved 96.2% overall accuracy in first-visit samples and 86.4% overall accuracy in follow-up testing. SHAP revealed patient-specific drivers and suggested biological alignment of IBD-U cases toward CD-like or UC-like profiles.\n\nConclusionsThis first-in-field integration of salivary proteomics with interpretable AI/ML demonstrates that accurate, noninvasive classification of pediatric IBD is possible using minimal biomarker sets.

However, their potential impact, generalisability, and biological relevance is hard to assess without understanding the origins and role of the thousands of proteins implicated in these studies. Here, we provide a data-driven identification of factors explaining variation in plasma levels of [~]3,000 proteins among 43,240 participants of the UK Biobank that explain their links to ageing and diseases, and help guide protein biomarker and drug target discovery. We use machine learning to systematically identify a median of 20 factors (range: 1-37) out of >1,800 participant and sample charateristics that jointly explained an average of 19.4% (max. 100.0%) of the variance in plasma levels across protein targets. Proteins segregated into distinct clusters according to their explanatory factors, with modifiable characteristics explaining more variance compared to genetic variation (median: 10.0% vs 3.9%). We identify proteins for which the factors explaining varying levels in blood differed by sex (n=1374 proteins) or across ancestries (n=74 proteins). We establish a knowledge graph that integrates our findings with genetic studies and drug characteristics to guide identification of potential markers of drug target engagement. We demonstrate the value of our resource 1) by identifying disease-specific biomarkers, like matrix metalloproteinase 12 for abdominal aortic aneurysm, and 2) by developing a framework for phenotype enrichment of protein signatures from independent studies to identify underlying sources of variation.

Machine learning (ML) has been shown to excel in this task; however, there remains a lack of models developed specifically for the preclinical AD population, who display early signs of abnormal brain amyloidosis but remain cognitively unimpaired. Here, we trained and evaluated ML classifiers to predict whether individuals with preclinical AD will progress to mild cognitive impairment or dementia within multiple fixed time windows, ranging from one to five years. Models were trained on regional imaging features extracted from amyloid positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging pooled across seven independent sites and from two amyloid radiotracers ([18F]-florbetapir and [11C]-Pittsburgh-compound-B). Out-of-sample generalizability was evaluated via a leave-one-site-out and leave-one-tracer-out cross-validation. Classifiers achieved an out-of-sample receiver operating characteristic area-under-the-curve of 0.66 or greater when applied to all except one hold-out sites and 0.72 or greater when applied to each hold-out radiotracer. Additionally, when applying our models in a retroactive cohort enrichment analysis on A4 clinical trial data, we observed increased statistical power of detecting differences in amyloid accumulation between placebo and treatment arms after enrichment by ML stratifications. As emerging investigations of new disease-modifying therapies for AD increasingly focus on asymptomatic, preclinical populations, our findings underscore the potential applicability of ML-based patient stratification for recruiting more homogeneous cohorts and improving statistical power for detecting treatment effects for future clinical trials.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMachine learning can predict future cognitive impairment in preclinical Alzheimers\nC_LIO_LIModels achieved high out-of-sample ROC-AUC on external sites and PET tracers\nC_LIO_LIModels were able to distinguish cognitively stable from decliners in the A4 cohort\nC_LIO_LIML cohort enrichment enhanced secondary treatment effect detection in the A4 cohort\nC_LI",

Recent studies show that achieving pathologic complete response (pCR) after NAT correlates with higher event-free survival rates. Thus, accurate prediction of pCR is essential for personalizing breast cancer (BC) treatment to minimize side effects and improve effectiveness.\n\nMethodsWe used a machine learning model named XGBoost to predict pCR in BC patients. The classifier was trained on the expression values of 4,000 genes to predict pCR in ten arms of the I-SPY2 clinical trial. Based on these predictions, we developed a strategy to maximize pCR likelihood and identified influential genes using the importance scores from the model.\n\nResultsXGBoost models for three arms, Pembrolizumab, ABT 888 plus carboplatin, and T-DM1 plus pertuzumab, achieved the highest prediction accuracies with areas under the receiver operation characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.814, 0.792, and 0.788, respectively. If treatment assignments followed the XGBoost predictions, pCR rates for nine out of ten I-SPY2 arms could increase significantly, by 9.9% to 29.1% compared to trial results. Key genes associated with pCR were identified for each arm. The expression levels of some genes, including lower expression of ABDH1, AMZ1, BAIAP3 and SYTL4 and higher expression of DENND1C, HMGB3, HMMR, PLEKHF1 and RASEF, were associated with pCR in multiple arms.\n\nConclusionThe machine learning models developed in this study provide accurate pCR predictions, improve pCR rates, and may find clinical applications to enhance the treatment for BC patients.",

Restrictive fluid strategy may benefit some patients, however, identifying them is challenging. Novel causal machine learning (ML) techniques can estimate heterogenous treatments effects (HTE) of IV fluids among these patients.\n\nObjectivesTo develop and validate causal ML framework to identify patients who benefit from restrictive fluids (<500mL fluids within 24 hours after AKI).\n\nDesign, Setting and ParticipantsWe conducted a retrospective study among patients with sepsis who developed AKI within 48 hours of ICU admission. We developed a causal ML approach to estimate individualized treatment effects and guide fluid therapy. We developed the model in MIMIC-IV and externally validated in SICdb.\n\nMain Outcomes and MeasuresOur primary outcome was early AKI reversal at 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included sustained AKI reversal and major adverse kidney events by 30 days (MAKE30). Model performance to identify HTE of restrictive IV fluids was assessed using area under targeting operator characteristic curve (AUTOC), that quantifies how well a model captures HTE and compared to random forest model.\n\nResultsCausal forest model outperformed random forest in identifying HTE of restrictive IV fluids with AUTOC 0.15 vs. -0.02 in external validation cohort. Among 1,931 patients in external validation cohort, the model recommended restrictive fluids for 68.9%. Among these, patients who received restrictive fluids demonstrated significantly higher rate of early AKI reversal (53.9% vs 33.2%, p<0.001), sustained AKI reversal (34.2% vs 18.0%, p<0.001) and lower rates of MAKE30 (17.1% vs 34.6%, p=0.003). Results were consistent in adjusted analysis.\n\nConclusions and RelevanceCausal ML framework outperformed random forest model in identifying patients with AKI and sepsis who benefit from restrictive fluid therapy.

In total, 419 urine samples were prospectively collected and comprehensively sequenced, comprising three urological cancer cohorts--renal cell carcinoma (RCC, n=96), prostate cancer (PCa, n=153), and urothelial carcinoma (UC, n=131)--while healthy subjects were recruited as counterparts. Machine learning algorithms could distinguish patients with RCC, PCa, or UC from healthy individuals with high discriminatory performance for all three cancers, with AUCs of 0.92 for RCC, 0.92 for PCa, and 0.96 for UC. Furthermore, we developed urinary miRNA-based prognostic models using a panel of up to five urinary miRNAs for each cancer type, revealing time-dependent AUCs of recurrence-free survival ranging from 0.74 to 0.89 across all three cancer types at 48 months of follow-up, demonstrating high discriminatory power for long-term recurrence.

The dataset included patient demographics (including age, sex, and BMI), as well as the maximum and minimum common laboratory values measured prior to each surgery (including electrolytes, eGFR, and red cell distribution width).\n\nResultsOf the models tested, logistic regression outperformed all other approaches with respect to accuracy (p = 0.0075 with respect to a two-tailed t-test with the next strongest model). The model had an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 85.07%, 82.89%, 85.19% respectively. Furthermore, features weighted heavily by the model are consistent with known predictors of mortality in the literature.\n\nConclusionPre-operative laboratory values are effective predictors of all-cause one-year mortality post-cardiovascular surgery used in conjunction with machine learning.

        "abstract": "Breast cancer, which is among the top causes of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide, demonstrates the importance of effective and rapid diagnostic tools, especially in early diagnosis, to enhance the survival level. Although machine learning (ML) advances have had an increasing number of medical imaging applications, limitations of diversity and applicability of datasets, the interpretation and efficiency of models remain a challenge to clinical use. The paper assesses eight of the most popular ML models, such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and a Hybrid model based on the Mammogram Mastery dataset of Iraq-Sulaymaniyah, which consists of 745 original and 9,685 augmented mammogram images. The hybrid model has the best accuracy (0.9667) and F1 Score (0.9444), and the KAN model has the best ROC AUC (0.9760) and Log Loss (0.1421), meaning they are best in terms of discriminative power and proper calibration. Random Forest, which has the lowest false negatives (3) when compared with Fast Multinomial and Fast Text, became most secure in clinical screening since it struck a balance between sensitivity and computing efficiency. The two practical challenges, though, are the slow inference time of the KAN model (0.323 seconds) and the expensive training cost (1009.10 seconds) of the Hybrid model. These insights explain that the Hybrid and KAN models are promising means of improving the accuracy of the diagnostics, and Random Forest can serve as a practically representative tool for reducing the number of missed diagnoses. The context of future research needs to address multi-dataset validation from multiple institutions, speed optimization of inference, multi-classification, and improved interpretability that will be used in clinically integrative settings. By addressing these gaps, ML-based diagnostics have the potential to increase the rate of breast cancer diagnosis, minimizing diagnostic errors and improving patient outcomes in various clinical contexts, which can facilitate the scaling of screening services available across the world.",

The present study establishes a machine learning-based framework employing a two-step feature selection strategy consisting of analysis of variance and coupled support vector machines - recursive feature elimination that delineates biomolecular signatures in HNSC and OSCC. Based on these signatures, classification models with high classification and prediction accuracies were developed which highlighted the significance of selected 22 HNSC and 23 OSCC candidate genes. Further, K-means clustering supported this finding by displaying a clear demarcation of the normal and tumor classes while previous literature confirmed the importance of the biomolecular signatures in several cancers. Specifically, it has been reported that FAM107A, FAM3D and CXCR2 could be probable diagnostic or prognostic candidates while RRAGD, PPL, AQP7, SORT1, MAB21L4 and UBL3 were earlier suggested to have therapeutic roles in cancer. Three overlapping genes namely, ENDOU, RRAGD and SMIM5 could be imperative because of their commonality between HNSC and OSCC. Likewise, seven features related to plasma membrane i.e., CEACAM1, COBL, GPX3, HCG22, MUC21, PAX9 and SMIM5 were identified that could essentially be targeted as non-invasive diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic candidates.

SHAP analysis was applied to interpret model outputs. We identified five key determinants: family, interpersonal relationships, health, life goal clarity, and financial stability. Family relationship satisfaction, interpersonal relationship satisfaction, and health are protective factors, all of which show nonlinear associations with SWB, including pronounced threshold effects: when scores exceed 5-6 on a 10-point scale, SWB increases sharply, underscoring the importance of reaching sufficient intervention intensity. In contrast, financial safety and goal clarity function as motivational factors. Gradient Boosting demonstrated the strongest predictive performance. These findings highlight several actionable levers for enhancing SWB, including strengthening social relationships, improving health, clarifying life goals, and ensuring financial safety. Importantly, the presence of threshold effects suggests that benefits are not uniformly distributed but disproportionately realized among individuals with lower baseline conditions--often the most vulnerable.",

The diversity of symptom presentations often results in challenges in diagnosis. Crucial clinical information remains in unstructured narrative notes within electronic health records (EHRs). We leverage large language models (LLMs) for symptom phenotyping from notes in UCSF Information Commons, focusing on patients with expert dementia syndrome diagnosed from a multidisciplinary team of specialists from the UCSF Memory and Aging Center. We developed a pipeline to extract findings in a validated structured output, clustered into symptom groups, and then classified patients into syndromes with traditional machine learning paradigms. From over 9,000 cross-referenced patients and over 350,000 specialty-related notes, matched cohorts of bvFTD (122 patients) and AD (170) syndromes were identified. From notes, 12,637 distinct symptom phrases were extracted, with clustering analysis revealing 51 symptom groups. A logistic regression model separated AD and bvFTD with an AUC of 0.83. Disinhibition and obsessive-compulsive behaviors favored bvFTD, while anxiety and visuospatial abnormalities favored AD. This novel approach, combining LLM-based structured information extraction with traditional interpretable prediction paradigms, demonstrates a promising approach for enhanced symptom characterization in dementia. Our findings suggest potential future applications in improving diagnostic accuracy, developing prediction models, and optimizing treatment strategies in dementia care.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUNDPulmonary hypertension (PH) is a highly morbid disease, but underdiagnosis is common outside of expert referral centers. Consequentially, there may be opportunities to automate PH diagnosis using artificial intelligence (AI) clinical decision support tools. Analysis of patient-level right heart catheterization (RHC) data is required to optimize AI-based PH diagnosis but has not been reported previously.\n\nMETHODSWe performed a retrospective cohort analysis of all RHC studies (January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2024) performed at the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS), which is a Maryland statewide clinical network of 12 hospitals serving >2 million patients. We developed an automated large language model (LLM)-driven Pattern Repository (LDPR) method, featuring three task-specific LLM agents for extracting unstructured RHC data, which was manually cross-validated independently by two PH experts. To address data missingness, we used machine-learning to develop formulae to calculate mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) from systolic (sPAP) and diastolic (dPAP) PAP, using an 80/20 train-test split.\n\nRESULTSThe study cohort included N=11,029 unique patients and 17,292 RHC reports (age 66{+/-}13.5 years; 43% female; 65% White, 30% Black or African American; mPAP, 28{+/-}11mmHg; 26% congestive heart failure). The precision for accurate mPAP, sPAP, and dPAP extraction by the LLM was 99.6%, 99.4%, and 99.4%, respectively, with a detection failure of 0.4%. A missing mPAP was noted in N=548 cases and N=507 unique patients (3.2% and 4.6%, respectively). When applying ML to the dataset, the simple, linear equation: mPAP=1.51+0.43*sPAP+0.45*dPAP returned the highest R2 of 0.94 and lowest mean square error of 8.3 mmHg, which outperformed linear equations used currently (all p<0.001). The ML-derived formula was then directed to patients with missing mPAP (N=507) and identified N=382 patients (75.3%) with mPAP >20mmHg, and therefore reclassifying patients from no diagnosis to a diagnosis of PH.\n\nCONCLUSIONIn this retrospective cohort analysis, combination LLM-ML-based extraction and interpretation of RHC was used to automate PH diagnosis in a large and heterogenous patient population. This approach is an efficient and scalable solution to preventing under-diagnosis of PH and demonstrates the feasibility of generative AI for advancing clinically-actionable tools that can improve cardiovascular disease phenotyping and diagnosis in real-world settings.",

We conducted a retrospective, multi-site cohort study including 58,839 pregnancies delivered at three NewYork-Presbyterian hospitals. Using routine information captured within the electronic health record (EHR), including blood pressure with other maternal characteristics, and routine laboratory tests, we developed extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) based models to predict PE onset within 1-, 2-, and 4-week horizons across different gestational ages. Performance was assessed using nested cross-validation at the training site and externally validated through direct transfer, fine-tuning, and retraining strategies. Prediction accuracy increased from 28 to 34 weeks of gestational age, peaked at 34 weeks (AUC 0.863 at training; 0.808-0.834 at validation), declined at 38 weeks, and rebounded near delivery (AUC up to 0.890). Blood pressure was the most consistent predictor, while laboratory features such as albumin, alkaline phosphatase, and hematologic indices added value earlier, and demographic and obstetric factors gaining importance later. Dynamic short-term prediction of PE in late gestation is feasible using routine data. This pragmatic, scalable approach provides opportunities for early intervention and is adaptable across diverse healthcare settings.",

Using SMOTE for class balancing and 5-fold cross-validation, we evaluate five ML models (CatBoost, RandomForest, ExtraTree, DecisionTree, SVC) against label encoding and rule-based baselines. RandomForest achieves a weighted F1 score of 90%, significantly outperforming baselines (best weighted F1: 68%).

        "abstract": "Reducing the global burden of disease is crucial for improving health outcomes worldwide. However, funding gaps leave vulnerable populations without necessary support for major health challenges, particularly in the least developed countries. In this paper, we develop a machine learning framework using large language models to track flows in official development assistance (ODA) earmarked for health and identify funding gaps. Specifically, we classified 3.7 million development aid projects from 2000 to 2022 (USD [~]332 billion) into 17 major categories of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNNDs) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). We then compared the rank of per capita ODA disbursement against the rank of disease burden (i.e., disability-adjusted life years [DALYs]) to identify relative funding gaps at the country level. Even though funding and disease burden are significantly correlated for many diseases, there are notable disparities. For example, NCDs account for 59.5% of global DALYs but received only 2.5% of health-related ODA. This disparity is particularly concerning because, in low and middle-income countries, there is an increasing double burden: not only from the traditional burden of CMNNDs, but also from the rising burden of NCDs. Our results also show that several regions face severe funding gaps across multiple diseases including Central Africa and parts of South Asia and West Africa. Our results identify health disparities to inform public policy decisions in development aid assistance. Overall, our machine learning framework helps identify health disparities and thereby supports the targeted allocation of health aid where it is most needed, thereby reducing the global burden of diseases.",

ViTs process images similarly to how humans visually perceive details and are useful for analyzing complex medical images. Transfer learning is a technique that uses models previously trained on large datasets and adapts them to specific use cases. Using transfer learning, this study aimed to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of meningioma location and demonstrate the capabilities the new technology.\n\nApproachWe used a Google ViT model pre-trained on ImageNet-21k (a dataset with 14 million images and 21,843 classes) and fine-tuned on ImageNet 2012 (a dataset with 1 million images and 1,000 classes). Using this model, which was pre-trained and fine-tuned on large datasets of images, allowed us to leverage the predictive capabilities of the model trained on those large datasets without needing to train an entirely new model specific to only meningioma MRI scans. Transfer learning was used to adapt the pre-trained ViT to our specific use case, being meningioma location classification, using a dataset of 1,094 images of T1, contrast-enhanced, and T2-weighted MRI scans of meningiomas sorted according to location in the brain, with 11 different classes.\n\nResultsThe final model trained and adapted on the meningioma MRI dataset achieved an average validation accuracy of 98.17% and a test accuracy of 89.95%.\n\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates the potential of ViTs in meningioma location classification, leveraging their ability to analyze spatial relationships in medical images. While transfer learning enabled effective adaptation with limited data, class imbalance affected classification performance.

A dataset of 50 subjects from the UCSF Brain Metastases collection was analyzed, including pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted images and corresponding segmentation masks. We designed advanced feature extraction strategies capturing intensity, enhancement patterns, texture gradients, and histogram-based metrics, resulting in 44 quantitative descriptors per subject. To address the severe class imbalance (46 metastasis vs. 4 non-metastasis cases), we applied minority oversampling and noise-based augmentation, combined with stratified cross-validation. Among multiple classifiers, Random Forest consistently achieved the highest performance with an average accuracy of 96.7% and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.99 across five folds. The proposed approach highlights the potential of handcrafted radiomic-like features coupled with machine learning to improve metastasis detection in heterogeneous clinical MRI cohorts.

This study developed a machine learning model to predict short-duration (4-6 weeks) DAA response using baseline clinical factors with potential to improve treatment uptake, cost-effectiveness and health system efficiency.\n\nMethodsBaseline data from several short-duration DAA clinical trials and treatment discontinuations from real-world cohort studies were used. Multiple machine learning models were evaluated. Nested cross-validation was employed to optimise model hyperparameters and assess performance. Clinical utility was evaluated using Area Under Receiver Operator Characteristics (AUROC), Area Under Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC) and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Threshold optimisation strategies were applied to balance model accuracy and DAA costs. Statistical analyses were conducted to estimate HCV RNA cutoffs predictive of treatment failure.\n\nResultsOf 264 receiving short-duration DAAs (median 42 days; interquartile range 28-42), 94 (36%) experienced treatment failure. Predictors of failure included shorter durations, higher HCV RNA, higher AST-ALT ratio, genotype 3, and DAA class. The Elastic Net (regularised logistic regression) model demonstrated strong performance (AUROC: 83%; AUPRC: 73%). The Youden Index threshold balanced sensitivity (81%) and specificity (76%) with MCC of 0.56. A cost-optimized threshold, prioritizing retreatment minimization, achieved high sensitivity (98%) but reduced specificity (51%). HCV RNA cutoffs predictive of treatment failure were higher for protease+NS5A vs. NS5A+NS5B inhibitors.\n\nConclusionPredictive models using baseline clinical data can identify individuals likely to respond to short-duration DAAs, with tailored thresholds enhancing clinical utility.

Geographic identifiers alone had limited explanatory value after accounting for socioeconomic and behavioral metrics.\n\nConclusionsGeographic disparities in CVD mortality are explained by underlying socioeconomic disadvantage and community health behaviors. Effective reduction of disparities requires public health interventions addressing poverty, education, and behavioral risk factors beyond clinical care.\n\nWhat Is New?Explanatory vs. Predictive Modeling: Previous research has largely focused on identifying geographic disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. This study goes further by not only predicting mortality but also explaining why disparities exist, quantifying the relative importance of socioeconomic, behavioral, and healthcare access determinants.\n\nAdvanced InterpretationWe apply SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), an advanced interpretability framework in machine learning, to measure precisely the effect of each county-level characteristic on mortality, uncovering complex patterns and interactions.\n\nIntegrated Data ApproachBy combining recent granular datasets on health outcomes, socioeconomic context, and behaviors, this study produces a multi-domain explanatory model of CVD mortality drivers at the national scale.\n\nClinical ImplicationsFindings show that clinical interventions alone are insufficient to eliminate disparities in CVD mortality, since the most powerful predictors are upstream social determinants of health.\n\nThis evidence supports the need for clinicians and health systems to partner in policies that address economic stability, educational access, and environments conducive to healthier behaviors. Strategic targeting of resources toward communities with high poverty and low educational attainment may yield more effective and equitable reductions in the national CVD burden compared to approaches focused only on clinical care.",

The anterior visual pathway has been demonstrated to be of central importance in diagnostic considerations for MS and has recently been identified as a fifth topography in the McDonald Diagnostic Criteria for MS. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides high-resolution retinal imaging and reflects the structural integrity of the retinal nerve fiber and ganglion cell inner plexiform layers. Whether multimodal deep learning models can use OCT alone to diagnose pediatric MS (POMS) is unknown.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed 3D OCT scans collected prospectively through the Neuroinflammatory Registry of the Hospital for Sick Children (REB#1000005356). Raw macular and optic nerve head images, and 52 automatically segmented features were included. We evaluated three classification approaches: (1) deep learning models (e.g. ResNet, DenseNet) for representation learning followed by classical ML classifiers, (2) ML models trained on OCT-derived features, and (3) multimodal models combining both via early and late fusion.\n\nResultsScans from individuals with POMS (onset 16.0 {+/-} 3.1 years, 51.0%F; 211 scans) and 29 children with non-inflammatory neurological conditions (13.1 {+/-} 4.0 years, 69.0%F, 52 scans) were included. The early fusion model achieved the highest performance (AUC: 0.87, F1: 0.87, Accuracy: 90%), outperforming both unimodal and late fusion models. The best unimodal feature-based model (SVC) yielded an AUC of 0.84, F1 of 0.85 and an accuracy of 85%, while the best image-based model (ResNet101 with Random Forest) achieved an AUC of 0.87, F1 of 0.79, and accuracy of 84%. Late fusion underperformed, reaching 82% accuracy but failing in the minority class.\n\nDiscussionMultimodal learning with early fusion significantly enhances diagnostic performance by combining spatial retinal information with clinically relevant structural features. This approach captures complementary patterns associated with MS pathology and shows promise as an AI-driven tool to support pediatric neuroinflammatory diagnosis.",

We examine the extent to which standard ML models underestimate utilization in disadvantaged populations and quantify the resulting distortion in national-level cost projections.\n\nMethodsUsing data from 55,698 respondents in the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI), we trained two sets of ML models to predict outpatient and inpatient utilization: one on the full population (Model 1), and another on a subsample with met healthcare needs (Model 2). Gradient Boosting was selected as the best-performing algorithm. To interpret model predictions and identify key drivers of healthcare utilization, we applied SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). We compared model outputs across socioeconomic subgroups and extrapolated predicted utilization to national population estimates using WHO-CHOICE unit costs.\n\nFindingsModel 1 consistently underestimated healthcare utilization relative to Model 2, particularly among lower-income and caste-identified groups. Overall, outpatient and inpatient predictions from Model 2 were 8.92 (95% CI: 8.87-8.99)% and 9.59 (9.28-9.85)% higher, respectively. Nationally, this translated to an underestimation of I$390.7 (391.2-391.5) million in outpatient care and I$88.4 (86.2-90.1) million in inpatient care. The largest gaps were concentrated in the poorest and most marginalized subgroups. The SHAP analysis suggests that self-rated health (SRH), economic status (MPCE), and chronic conditions are consistently influential in predicting outpatient and inpatient visits, with some shifts in feature importance between models.\n\nConclusionMachine learning models trained on unadjusted population data lead to algorithmic bias and risk perpetuating structural inequities by underrepresenting unmet need.

        "abstract": "The health consequences of ionizing radiation have long been studied, yet significant uncertainties remain, particularly at low doses. In particular, traditional dose-response models such as linear, linear-quadratic, threshold, or hormesis models, all impose specific assumptions about low-dose effects. In addition, while the goal of radiation epidemiological studies is ideally to uncover causal relationships between dose and health effects, most conventional data analysis techniques can only establish associations rather than causation. These limitations highlight the need for new analysis methodologies that can eliminate the need for a priori dose-response assumptions and can provide causal inferences more directly based on observational data. Causal Machine Learning (CML) is a new approach designed to uncover how changes in one variable directly influence another, and with these motivations, a CML approach was, for the first time, implemented here to analyze radiation epidemiological data - in this case all-cause mortality data from Japanese A-bomb survivors. Compared to more traditional parametric approaches for analyzing radiation epidemiological data such as Poisson regression, CML makes no a priori assumptions about dose-effect response shapes (e.g., linearity or thresholds). Extensive validation and refutation tests indicated that the proposed CML methodology is robust and is not overly sensitive to unmeasured confounding and noise. At moderate to high radiation doses, the CML analysis supports a causal increase in mortality with radiation exposure, with a statistically significant positive average treatment effect (p = 0.014). By contrast, no statistically significant causal increase in all-cause mortality was detected at doses below 0.05 Gy (50 mGy). These conclusions were drawn after adjusting for all available key covariates including attained age, age at exposure, and sex. We emphasize that this CML-based approach is not designed to validate or disprove any particular dose-response model. Rather this approach represents a new potentially complementary approach that does not rely on a priori functional form assumptions.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundDengue fever remains a critical public health challenge in Thailand, with transmission dynamics driven by complex interactions between environmental and socioeconomic factors. Understanding these drivers is essential for developing robust prediction systems.\n\nMethodsWe developed a machine learning framework to classify spatiotemporal dengue risk and identify key drivers of transmission across Thailand. We analyzed 20 years of monthly dengue hemorrhagic fever surveillance data (2003-2022) from 77 provinces, integrating 54 environmental, climatic, and socioeconomic variables. Using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we classified provinces as high-risk or low-risk based on the national median incidence. The dataset was stratified into training (2003-2016) and testing periods, with the latter subdivided into pre-COVID-19 (2017-2019), COVID-19 (2020-2021), and post-COVID-19 (2022) phases.\n\nResultsThe model achieved robust performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 during training and 0.80 in pre-pandemic testing. Temperature emerged as the dominant predictor, with temperature-related variables comprising seven of the ten most influential features. Critical transmission thresholds were identified at approximately 21{degrees}C for a 1-month lagged minimum temperature and approximately 32{degrees}C for a 3-month lagged maximum temperature. Interestingly, precipitation contributed minimally to model predictions, while a higher Gross Provincial Product was associated with an increased risk of dengue, reflecting urban transmission patterns. Model performance deteriorated significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic (AUC = 0.62 in 2021), with systematic overprediction suggesting that behavioral factors outweighed environmental drivers during the pandemic disruption.\n\nConclusionsTemperature, particularly with lags of 1-3 months, is the primary predictor of dengue risk in Thailand. The pandemic-induced disruption of model accuracy underscores the crucial role of human behavioral factors in influencing dengue transmission dynamics. Our results challenge traditional precipitation-focused models and highlight the importance of temperature-driven approaches for dengue prediction in Thailand.\n\nPlain language summaryThis study used machine learning to predict dengue fever outbreaks across Thailands provinces from 2003 to 2022. By analyzing climate data, economic indicators, and satellite imagery, our machine learning model could accurately identify high-risk areas about 80% of the time. We found that temperature is the most important factor determining where and when dengue will spread. Additionally, we identified a critical temperature threshold where dengue transmission essentially stops when minimum temperatures drop below approximately 21{degrees}C. Surprisingly, rainfall patterns, which are often emphasized in dengue predictions, played a much smaller role than expected. Higher economic development was also found to be associated with an increased risk of dengue, probably due to urbanization creating ideal conditions for mosquitoes to breed all year round and higher human population density that facilitates virus transmission. However, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the models accuracy, causing it to predict more dengue cases than actually occurred from 2020 to 2022, likely due to the COVID-19 control measures that climate data alone could not capture. This research demonstrates both the power and limitations of using environmental and socioeconomic data to predict dengue outbreaks in Thailand.",

The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality of ICU patients with acute myocardial infarction. Univariate analysis was performed to screen statistically significant variables, and Lasso regression was used to further identify independent influencing factors that were significantly related to the risk of death. Based on the screened variables, we developed multiple machine learning(ML) models and evaluated their predictive efficiency for the risk of death in ICU patients with acute myocardial infarction.\n\nResultsA total of 2285 ICU-admitted AMI patients were included, and 613 AMI patients died in the ICU. After the screening process, a total of 15 clinical characteristic variables were included in developing logistic regression models and ten ML models (each model utilized the same 15 clinical characteristics), and the table outlines the predictive performance of these models. According to the area under the Area Under the Curve(AUC), the 3 prediction models showed good predictive efficacy for AMI ICU mortality risk.

Tibialis anterior delta-band CMC and medio-lateral root mean square COP predicted BBS and TUG. These features capture the dynamic stability mechanisms shared across the two clinical tests of balance and functional mobility. Soleus theta-band CMC asymmetry index predicted BBS, whereas TUG was predicted by biceps femoris beta-band CMC asymmetry index and rectus femoris beta-band CMC.

We considered 73 baseline features, including age, sex, menopause status, and bone mineral density (BMD), and the outcome was the first incidence of fracture at any of the following sites: hip, spine, pelvis, ribs, shoulder, and forearm, over a 19-year follow-up period. Data were divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) datasets. The ML algorithms were trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset in terms of the ROC_AUC. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was performed to identify the important features that contribute to the prediction of fracture, and to investigate the interaction among these features.\n\nIn total, 7,753 subjects were included in the study. Approximately 72% were female, and the average age was 67 years. We found that the XGBoost algorithm had a slightly better ROC_AUC (0.70; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.73). From the SHAP analysis, we found that BMD was the most important feature that contributed to the prediction. The other important features include age, previous fracture, osteoporosis and menopausal status. Total hip BMD interacted the most with femoral neck BMD, lumbar spine BMD interacted the most with weight, previous fracture status interacted the most with femoral neck BMD, and age interacted the most with lumbar spine BMD.\n\nThis study demonstrated that XGBoost was the most effective algorithm for predicting fragility fractures. In addition, we identified important features that contribute to the prediction of fragility fractures. Intervention focusing on these features will help to prevent the incidence of these fractures.\n\nLay summariesWe developed machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict fragility fractures, considering the incidence of fractures at different skeletal sites, including the hip, spine, pelvis, ribs, shoulder, or forearm, using 19 years of follow-up data from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos).

We identified important factors that increase the risk of fractures, including BMD, age, and previous fracture. We also demonstrated how the interaction between these factors increases the risk of fractures. The intervention focusing on these factors will help to prevent fragility fractures.",

        "abstract": "Hospital readmissions represent a persistent challenge for healthcare systems, often stemming from inadequate post-discharge monitoring. This study presents a Machine Learning (ML)-driven Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) designed to enhance nursing risk assessment in post-discharge care.\n\nDeveloped using a Design Science Research Methodology, the artefact integrates a digital questionnaire, an ML-based risk stratification model, and a real-time dashboard to optimise follow-up processes. The system was developed at a medical-surgical inpatient unit of a private hospital in Portugal. A retrospective dataset of 10,134 structured telephone follow-up records, classified by nurses into three risk levels--stable (A), requiring reassessment (B), and clinically concerning (C)--was used to train and evaluate the ML model.\n\nAmong the evaluated classifiers, Logistic Regression was selected for deployment based on its high specificity (0.9993), precision (0.9879), and absence of critical false negatives, despite slightly lower recall compared to XGBoost. The CDSS enables real-time risk classification based on patient-reported outcomes, supporting timely identification and prioritisation of patients requiring clinical attention. Simulation results indicate a potential reduction of up to 79% in nurse follow-up workload, while preserving care quality by focusing resources on moderate- and high-risk patients. Although direct evidence of reduced readmissions is not yet available, the system aligns with established best practices in transitional care. This study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of ML-based dynamic risk stratification for post-discharge monitoring, offering a scalable and interpretable solution that enhances clinical decision-making and resource allocation in nursing practice.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundWeight gain is a common side effect in patients treated with olanzapine (N05AH03), contributing to increased risks of metabolic complications such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and reduced treatment adherence. However, personalised prevention strategies are currently lacking in day-to-day clinical practice. Identifying factors that can predict which patients are most likely to gain a significant amount of weight is therefore critical. Such insights could enable early risk prediction and guide clinicians in implementing personalized interventions to minimize side effects and improve long-term treatment outcomes.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we developed explainable machine learning models using population-based Electronic Health Record data and compared the performance between logistic regression, decision trees and ensemble tree classifiers like XGboost to predict significant BMI increase of >5% in the next contact to the clinic while on olanzapine.\n\nResultsXGBoost model achieved the highest performance for predicting a >5% BMI increase on olanzapine with an AUROC of 0.72, surpassing logistic regression (AUROC = 0.69) and other evaluated classifiers. Model performance was consistent across sexes, but varied across age groups, with the highest performance for individuals 30-69 years of age (AUROC = 0.73) and lowest in individuals over 70 years of age (AUROC = 0.67). The SHAP analysis highlighted several key predictive features including prolonged intervals between follow-up visits, higher baseline BMI, younger age, shorter time since olanzapine initiation, cumulative hospitalization days, increasing olanzapine dosage, polypharmacy and especially concurrent use of sedatives as well as multiple prescriptions with anxiolytics.\n\nConclusionOur models validate prior known risk factors for olanzapine induced weight gain and further uncover previously unknown factors that influence >5% BMI increase on olanzapine. These findings underscore the need for continued research in this domain to establish effective preventive measures for individuals undergoing antipsychotic treatments.",

        "abstract": "Epilepsy affects around 1% of the global population and often requires long-term treatment with antiseizure medications (ASMs). However, the current treatment strategy is based on clinical acumen and trial and error, resulting in only about 50% of patients remaining seizure-free for at least 12 months with first-line ASMs. Valproic acid (VPA) is a commonly prescribed first-line ASM, yet <50% of patients experience inadequate seizure control (ISC) or unacceptable adverse reactions (UARs), necessitating discontinuation. We developed a predictive algorithm to support VPA treatment decisions in eligible epilepsy patients integrating in-vitro data, genetic data and previous knowledge. Our approach is based on genetic variations in genes associated with VPA pharmacodynamics and -kinetics, as well as the response of human neurons to VPA (in-vitro). The multimodal pipeline integrates patients common and rare genetic variants of genes related to these pathways. The feature engineering pipeline was trained and tested on a multi-ethnic external dataset and the final classifier trained and tested on the Epi25 cohort of patients. The proof-of-concept validation was performed in an independently collected cohort and confirmed the potential to predict VPA treatment response. Overall performance was modest. However, prediction accuracy and the high negative predictive value highlight the potential for clinical values. We estimated a significant reduction in the time to successful treatment, decreasing both patient burden and overall healthcare costs. While our prototype is not yet at a clinically-ready stage and the need for SNP and WES data is limiting feasibility, the results suggest that a translational biomarker-based algorithm is promising in personalizing epilepsy treatment with VPA, shifting away from the one-size-fits-all approach. This could enhance treatment efficacy, reduce ISC and UARs, and improve patients quality of life by shortening the time to achieve seizure freedom.",

Our primary emphasis is on identifying and mitigating biases within the OBF-Psychiatric dataset for ADHD and CONTROL groups, exploring how these biases influence machine learning model performance and generalizability. To balance patient inclusion with data quality, we applied innovative Pareto optimization and rigorous quality criteria, establishing optimal temporal windows, selecting 16:00 to 23:00 hours involving 53 patients from 77 available. Statistical analysis used robust Brunner-Munzel tests with False Discovery Rate correction, examining 34 comprehensive features spanning statistical, complexity, and frequency-based domains. Following thorough corrections, no significant differences in motor activity features emerged between the ADHD and CONTROL groups in quality-controlled data. Multidimensional scaling confirmed considerable overlap between groups. We assessed six traditional supervised machine learning algorithms through Leave-One-Patient-Out cross-validation: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron, K-Nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost, plus baseline classifiers. Performance was evaluated across three data quality configurations to assess data processing consequences. Notably, performance systematically declined as data quality improved, with ROC AUC dropping from 75% (uncleaned) to 54% (quality-controlled). Our analysis suggests that the ADHD and CONTROL groups are indistinguishable using traditional feature-based motor activity patterns with these data collected in naturalistic conditions. However, the methodological contributions of this study provide foundations for future appropriately powered research and underscore key considerations for accelerometry utility in detecting adult ADHD and other psychiatric disorders in real-world scenarios.",

Despite recent advancements in the diagnosis techniques, a critical gap still persists in terms of time delay, high cost and false-positive predictions. Hence there is a critical requirement for rapid, reliable and cheap point-of-care diagnostic tools. As a vital step towards addressing this need, here we propose an Artificial Intelligence based diagnosis technique which involves microscopic images of dried patterns formed by E. coli bacteria-laden sessile urine droplets. In this study, the variation in the underlying pattern formation behavior with the change in bacterial concentration has been perceived through machine learning (deep residual network based) model pipeline for diagnosis and severity estimation. Image classification (pattern analysis) has been performed based on dried deposits/patterns obtained from evaporated bacteria-laden sessile urine droplets. In addition, the impact of bacterial concentration in a given urine sample has been studied, as an attempt to qualitatively estimate a severity index. Overall, this study focuses on understanding and unleashing the potential of analyzing dried deposit/pattern for UTI diagnosis, as a quick, cheap and accessible point-of-care application, which can be extended to cyber-physical systems as a robust, deployable diagnostic tool particularly in rural areas as a first-line diagnostic tool, allowing users to perform an initial self-assessment prior to consulting a medical professional.",

Early and accurate detection is vital for improving outcomes, yet conventional diagnostic approaches such as mammography, histopathology, and fine-needle aspirate (FNA) cytology can be limited by observer variability and overlapping morphological features. Machine learning (ML) offers a means to improve diagnostic accuracy by capturing subtle patterns in complex datasets.\n\nMethodsThis study employed the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic (WBCD) dataset, comprising 569 FNA cytology cases with 30 quantitative nuclear morphology features. After correlation analysis, 11 predictors were selected to reduce redundancy while retaining diagnostic power. The dataset was split into training and testing sets using an 85:15 stratified approach. Four supervised classifiers were implemented in Pythons scikit-learn library: Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Classifier (SVC). Models were tuned using GridSearchCV and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.\n\nResultsExploratory analysis showed malignant tumors exhibited larger nuclear size and higher concavity features than benign tumors.

The study included 5,342 participants aged 18 years and older, of which 2,107 (33.9%) had multimorbidity, defined as the presence of two or more chronic conditions.\n\nMain Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was the presence of multimorbidity.

Model performance was assessed using accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), recall, precision, F1 score, Cohens Kappa, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were used to identify the most influential predictors of multimorbidity.\n\nResultsThe Gradient Boosting Classifier achieved the highest predictive performance, with an AUC of 0.7809, accuracy of 0.7478, and F1 score of 0.5798. Age, no medication use, sex, poor health perception, and community illiteracy rate were identified as the most influential predictors of multimorbidity. Individual-level factors had a more substantial impact on the likelihood of multimorbidity compared to community-level factors. However, higher community illiteracy rates and regional unemployment rates were associated with an increased likelihood of multimorbidity, highlighting the importance of contextual factors.

        "abstract": "Extreme fatigue is a clinical symptom that affects >50% of individuals with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), with a similar prevalence across many common immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). Despite its ubiquity, human scientific studies have yet to explain the mechanistic basis of this pervasive and complex symptom. One fundamental reason for this, is our inability to account for the clinical heterogeneity of fatigue with its multifactorial nature. We present the conceptual machine learning (ML) framework to dissect the complex nature of fatigue using one of the largest prospectively captured, real-world patient-reported outcome (PROs) on wellbeing from three contemporaneous cohorts (2020-present), totalling 2,970 responses from 2,290 participants across the UK and internationally, including non-IBD controls with 100 lines of clinical metadata. We systematically defined the (1) threshold of fatigue as our primary outcome ([&ge;]10/14 fatigue days) to build our ML approach, (2) utilised routinely available clinical data that can be used at a population-level analysis, (3) employed seven different ML methods with external validation in 3 different cohorts in UK, Spain and Australia (n=252), (4) employed Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis to break down the clinical heterogeneity to allow the examination of clinical predictive factors at an individual level; and finally (5), investigate whether there are distinct clusters of fatigue patients. We found that ML models performed comparably (AUC/C-index [~]0.7) on external validation with SHAP analysis showing interpretable, individualised fatigue drivers and five distinct fatigue phenotypes, including a subgroup of young males with significantly lower fatigue burden. Our data therefore provides the ML  roadmap to predict and deconstruct fatigue in IBD and potentially also more widely in IMIDs, enabling patient-level dissection beyond symptom-based classification with the ability to integrate deep molecular data. This is a step towards future clinical-scientific AI models with the immediate clinical application to stratify patients to human experimental studies to better understand the dominant mechanisms that drive fatigue at an individual level.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) generally achieves excellent outcomes, 5-12% of recipients experience early graft dysfunction, which is associated with poorer long-term survival. Current predictive tools rely mainly on clinical parameters and lack intraoperative applicability. Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) enables real-time, non-contact assessment of renal microcirculation, and may provide complementary insight when integrated with machine learning (ML).\n\nMethodsIn this prospective cohort study, we performed intraoperative LSCI measurement in 110 adult LDKT recipients at Erasmus Medical Center. Early graft function was assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 1 week posttransplant, with patients classified as Group I (eGFR [&ge;] 30 mL/min/1.73 m{superscript 2}) and Group II (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m{superscript 2}). Two predefined feature sets were used for model development: (i) a Clinical Model (selected clinical variables) and (ii) a Combined Model (clinical + convolutional neural network [CNN]-derived LSCI features). Four ML algorithms (support vector machine [SVM], logistic regression, random forest [RF], and XGBoost) were trained using 5-fold cross-validation with Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and evaluated on independent test sets across 30 repeated iterations.\n\nResultsOf 110 recipients, 15 (17%) had eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m{superscript 2} at 1 week. Patients in Group II received kidneys from older donors with lower predonation eGFR, had higher BMI, more cardiovascular comorbidity, and greater intraoperative blood loss. The Combined Model consistently outperformed the Clinical Model across all algorithms. For example, SVM achieved higher accuracy (0.89 [95% CI, 0.85-0.92] vs. 0.79 [0.75-0.84]) and logistic regression yielded higher recall (0.86 [0.83-0.88] vs. 0.76 [0.74-0.79]). In independent test sets, Combined Models maintained better performance, with SVM achieving the highest F1 score (0.60 [0.50-0.71]) and RF achieving the highest recall (0.88 [0.50-1.00]). Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed that CNN-extracted features localized to physiologically relevant perfusion regions. LSCI also enabled real-time detection and correction of vascular complications in two cases.\n\nConclusionsIntegrating intraoperative LSCI features with clinical variables using ML significantly improved prediction of low one-week eGFR (< 30 mL/min/1.73m{superscript 2}) in LDKT compared with clinical data alone. LSCI also enabled real-time detection of vascular complications, underscoring its role as both a predictive and intraoperative guidance tool. Larger multicenter studies are warranted to validate its generalizability and explore applications in other transplant scenarios.",

The complex, multifactorial nature of IBS pain leads to highly variable and often inadequate responses to self-management, underscoring the urgent need for personalized prediction models.\n\nMethodsThis ancillary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (NCT03332537) utilized data from 80 young adults with IBS. We applied the Bayesian Additive Regression Trees machine learning algorithm to develop 27 distinct predictive models for pain severity, pain interference, and quality of life (QOL) at baseline and post-intervention. Predictors included a comprehensive, multi-domain set of variables spanning genetics, quantitative sensory testing, gut microbiota, psychosocial factors, and food intake.\n\nResultsModel performance was strong, with area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.753 to 0.981. A consistent hierarchy of predictors emerged. The COMT rs4680 polymorphism was the most significant predictor, featuring in 26 models, followed by ADRA1D rs1556832 in 24 models. The mechanical pain threshold was a key predictor of pain severity, while psychosocial factors, particularly pain catastrophizing, were crucial for pain interference and QOL. Gut microbiota features and food intake were also consistently important.\n\nDiscussionThis study establishes a comprehensive, multi-omics framework that explains individual differences in IBS pain and treatment response. The identified predictors provide a practical tool for advancing precision medicine. By classifying patients based on their distinct profiles, clinicians can proactively customize self-management strategies, potentially transforming care for this complex condition.\n\nWHAT IS KNOWNO_LIIBS pain involves complex, dysregulated gut-brain interactions.\nC_LIO_LITreatment response is highly variable and difficult to predict.\nC_LIO_LIMachine learning can help phenotype complex pain conditions.\nC_LI\n\nWHAT IS NEW HEREO_LIMachine learning based hierarchical models identify a core neurogenetic predisposition for IBS pain.\nC_LIO_LIMachine learning based prediction of individual response to self-management before treatment begins.\nC_LIO_LIThis provides a direct pathway to precision pain management in IBS.\nC_LI",

In this study, we analyzed RNA-seq data from 404 AML patients at initial diagnosis, leveraging a k-mer-based machine learning approach to uncover age-related transcriptomic differences in favorable and adverse risk groups. Our model achieved over 90% accuracy in risk prediction and identified key gene signatures distinguishing ELN2017 favorable and adverse groups. From these signatures, we selected prognostic biomarkers with significant impacts on survival. Additionally, we explored the biological context underlying transcriptomic complexity across age groups, revealing distinct tumor profiles and differences in immune and stromal cell populations, particularly in older patients. These findings underscore the importance of age-related molecular features in AML and provide new insights for risk stratification and therapeutic targeting.",
