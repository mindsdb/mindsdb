## About Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams is the ultimate messaging app for your organizationâ€”a workspace for real-time collaboration and communication, meetings, file and app sharing, and even the occasional emoji! All in one place, all in the open, all accessible to everyone.

## Microsoft Teams Handler Implementation

  This handler was implemented using [msal](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python) for authentication and [Requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) to submit requests to the Microsoft Graph API.

## Microsoft Teams Handler Initialization

The Microsoft Teams handler is initialized with the following parameters:

- `client_id`: The client ID of the registered Microsoft Entra ID application.
- `client_secret`: The client secret of the registered Microsoft Entra ID application.
- `tenant_id`: The tenant ID of the registered Microsoft Entra ID application.

Note: Microsoft Entra ID was previously known as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

The parameters given above can be obtained by registering an application in Microsoft Entra ID by following these steps,
1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home) and sign in with your Microsoft account.
2. Locate the **Microsoft Entra ID** service and click on it.
3. Click on **App registrations** and then click on **New registration**.
4. Enter a name for your application and select the **Accounts in this organizational directory only** option for the **Supported account types** field.
5. Keep the **Redirect URI** field empty and click on **Register**.
6. Click on **API permissions** and then click on **Add a permission**.
7. Select **Microsoft Graph** and then click on **Delegated permissions**.
8. Select the following permissions based on the data you want to access and the operations you want to perform:
    - Chats:
        - Chat.ReadBasic
        - Chat.Read
        - Chat.ReadWrite

    - Chat messages:
        - Chat.Read
        -	Chat.ReadWrite
        - Group.ReadWrite.All
  
    - Channels:
        - ChannelSettings.Read.All
        - ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.All
        - Directory.Read.All
        - Directory.ReadWrite.All
        - Group.Read.All
        - Group.ReadWrite.All

    - Channel messages:
        - ChannelMessage.Read.All
        - Group.Read.All
        - Group.ReadWrite.All
9. Click on **Add permissions**.
10. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and record it as the `client_id` parameter, and copy the **Directory (tenant) ID** and record it as the `tenant_id` parameter.
11. Click on **Certificates & secrets** and then click on **New client secret**.
12. Enter a description for your client secret and select an expiration period.
13. Click on **Add** and copy the generated client secret and record it as the `client_secret` parameter.
14. Click on **Authentication** and then click on **Add a platform**.
15. Select **Web** and enter URL where MindsDB has been deployed followed by `/verify-auth` in the **Redirect URIs** field. For example, if you are running MindsDB locally (on `http://localhost:47334`), enter `http://localhost:47334/verify-auth` in the **Redirect URIs** field.

You can find more information about creating app registrations [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2).

When the above is statement is executed with the given parameters, the handler will open a browser window and prompt you to sign in with your Microsoft account. 

The handler will then act (via the app registration) as the signed in user and will submit requests to the Microsoft Graph API. This is done using the concept of [delegated permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts#delegated-permissions).

## Example Usage

The first step is to create a database with the new `teams` engine by passing in the required parameters:

~~~~sql
CREATE DATABASE teams_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'teams',
PARAMETERS = {
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
  "tenant_id": "your-tenant-id"
};
~~~~

  Use the established connection to query your chats:

~~~~sql
SELECT * FROM teams_datasource.chats
~~~~

Now, post a message to a chat:

~~~~sql
INSERT INTO teams_datasource.chat_messages (chatId, body_content)
VALUES
('your-chat-id', 'Hello from MindsDB!');
~~~~

You can also do the same for channels:

~~~~sql
SELECT * FROM teams_datasource.channels
~~~~

~~~~sql
INSERT INTO teams_datasource.channel_messages (channelIdentity_teamId, channelIdentity_channelId, body_content)
VALUES
('your-team-id', 'your-channel-id', 'Hello from MindsDB!');
~~~~

## Create a Microsoft Teams Chatbot

While the Microsoft Teams handler allows you to read/send messages to a chat or channel as shown above, it is also possible to create a chat bot that will listen to messages sent to a chat or channel and respond to them.

### Step 1: Create a Microsoft Teams Data Source

As shown above, create a database with the new `teams` engine by passing in the required parameters:

~~~~sql
CREATE DATABASE teams_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'teams',
PARAMETERS = {
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
  "tenant_id": "your-tenant-id"
};
~~~~

Note: The chat bot will assume the identity of the user who signed in with their Microsoft account when the database was created.

### Step 2: Create an [Agent](https://docs.mindsdb.com/agents/agent)

An agent is created by combining a [Model](https://docs.mindsdb.com/model-types) (conversational) with optional Skills.

Here, we will create an agent without any skills, however, it is possilbe to create agents with skills such as the ability to answer questions from a knowledge base.

#### Step 2.1: Create a Conversational Model

Create a conversational model using either the `LangChain` or `LlamaIndex` integrations. Given below is an example of a conversational model created using the `LlamaIndex` integration:

~~~~sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE llama_index_engine
FROM llama_index
USING openai_api_key='your-openai-api-key';
~~~~

~~~~sql
CREATE MODEL llama_index_convo_model
PREDICT answer
USING
  engine = 'llama_index_engine',
  mode = 'conversational',
  prompt = 'answer users questions as a helpful assistant',
  user_column = 'question',
  assistant_column = 'answer';
~~~~

#### Step 2.2: Create an Agent using the Conversational Model

Let's create an agent using the conversational model created above:

~~~~sql
CREATE AGENT convo_agent
USING
    model = 'llama_index_convo_model',
~~~~

### Step 3: Create a [Chatbot](https://docs.mindsdb.com/agents/chatbot)

Finally, create a chatbot using the agent and the Microsoft Teams data source created above:

~~~~sql
CREATE CHATBOT teams_chatbot
USING
    database = 'teams_datasource',
    agent = 'convo_agent';
~~~~
