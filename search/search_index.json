By bringing machine learning to the database, MindsDB accelerates the speed of machine learning development. With MindsDB, you will easily build, train, optimize and deploy your models. Your predictions will be available via the queries you already use. What are AI Tables? \u00b6 There is an ongoing transformational shift within the modern business world from the \u201cwhat happened and why\u201d based on historical data analysis to the \u201cwhat will we predict can happen and how can we make it happen\u201d based on machine learning predictive modeling. The success of your predictions depends both on the data you have available and the models you train this data on. Data Scientists and Data Engineers need best-in-class tools to prepare the data for feature engineering, the best training models, and the best way of deploying, monitoring, and managing these implementations for optimal prediction confidence. Machine Learning (ML) Lifecycle \u00b6 The ML lifecycle can be represented as a process that consists of the data preparation phase, modeling phase, and deployment phase. The diagram below presents all the steps included in each of the stages. Companies looking to implement machine learning have found their current solutions require substantial amounts of data preparation, cleaning, and labeling, plus hard to find machine learning/AI data scientists to conduct feature engineering; build, train, and optimize models; assemble, verify, and deploy into production; and then monitor in real-time, improve, and refine. Machine learning models require multiple iterations with existing data to train. Additionally, extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from one system to another is complicated, leads to multiple copies of information, and is a compliance and tracking nightmare. A recent study has shown it takes 64% of companies a month, to over a year, to deploy a machine learning model into production\u00b9. Leveraging existing databases and automating the feature engineering, building, training, and optimization of models, assembling them, and deploying them into production is called AutoML and has been gaining traction within enterprises for enabling non-experts to use machine learning models for practical applications. MindsDB brings machine learning to existing SQL databases with a concept called AI Tables. AI Tables integrate the machine learning models as virtual tables inside a database, create predictions, and can be queried with simple SQL statements. Almost instantly, time series, regression, and classification predictions can be done directly in your database. Deep Dive into the AI Tables \u00b6 Let\u2019s consider the following income table that stores the income and debt values. SELECT income , debt FROM income_table ; A simple visualization of the data present in the income table is as follows. Querying the income table to get the debt value for a particular income value results in the following. SELECT income , debt FROM income WHERE income = 80000 ; But what happens when we query the table for income value that is not present? SELECT income , debt FROM income WHERE income = 90000 ; When a table doesn\u2019t have an exact match the query will return a null value. This is where the AI Tables come into play! Let\u2019s create a debt model that allows us to approximate the debt value for any income value. We\u2019ll train this debt model using the income table\u2019s data. CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . debt_model FROM income_table PREDICT debt ; MindsDB provides the CREATE PREDICTOR statement. When we execute this statement, the predictive model works in the background, automatically creating a vector representation of the data that can be visualized as follows. Let\u2019s now look for the debt value of some random income value. To get the approximated debt value, we query the debt_model and not the income table. SELECT income , debt FROM debt_model WHERE income = 90120 ; How can I help? \u00b6 You can help in the following ways: Trying MindsDB and reporting issues . If you know python, you can also help us debug open issues. Issues labels with the good first issue tag should be the easiest to start with . You can help us with documentation and examples. Tell your friends, write a blog post about MindsDB. Join our team, we are growing fast so we should have a few open positions . Why is it called MindsDB? \u00b6 Well, as most names, we needed one, we like science fiction and the culture series , where there are these AI super smart entities called Minds. How about the DB part? Although in the future we will support all kinds of data, currently our objective is to add intelligence to existing data stores/databases, hence the term DB. As to becoming a Mind to your DB . Why the bear? Who doesn't like bears!

With this, anyone who knows SQL can utilize the built-in machine learning techniques without needing any other outsourced tools or training. In short, MindsDB aims to provide intelligent databases to make better data-driven decisions in the existing database without the effort of creating a new one. Deployment on Digital Ocean \u00b6 Digital Ocean is a Cloud computing platform that provides cloud computing services with predictable pricing, developer-friendly features, and scalability as you need. Today, we will be deploying the MindsDB server on a Digital Ocean Droplet (a scalable virtual machine on DO Platform) and trying to connect to it using our local MySQL client or Dbeaver. Step 1: Sign up for a Digital Ocean account if you don't have one yet. They provide 100$ Credits when you sign up so that you can try it for free. Step 2: Once you've created an account, you should see a dashboard like this. If you look towards the left panel, you can find the Droplets option. Now click on Droplets. Step 3: Once you are in the Droplets Dashboard, hit Create Droplet . Step 4: Now the Create Droplet dashboard opens. Here you need to choose the configurations you want for your virtual machine and can also select any additional applications you want to install on your VM from the Marketplace. For now, we will move ahead with the following configurations that would boot up a standard VM for us with the required performance. Distributions : Ubuntu 20.04(LTS) x64 Choose a Plan : Shared CPU (Basic) CPU Options : $20/mo (4GB/2CPUs, 80GB SSD Disk, 4TB Transfer) Datacenter Region : Closest Region to you to reduce Latency (Bangalore for me) Authentication : SSH Key (If you have one) or Root Password (Set your Root Password below to login to the VM) Select Additional Option : Choose Monitoring and IPv6 which are free services Finalize and Create : Set the number of Droplets you want (1 for now) and the Name of Droplet Select a Project : Leave it at default for now Or you can simply go to the top and select Marketplace and search for Docker there and select Docker on Ubuntu directly, as we would be using Docker to install the MindsDB server on our Droplet, instead of choosing a Ubuntu LTS distribution and then installing docker on top of it manually. Hit Create Droplet and wait for a while till it spins one for us in the cloud. Step 5: Once your Droplet is created, you can always click on the Droplets in the left Navigation pane and Click on the Droplet name to go into the Droplet Dashboard details. Now click on the Console from the top right corner. This should open up a terminal for you where you can interact with your VM. Step 6: Now while you are inside the console, simply check whether Docker is installed or not using the following command. docker run hello-world If the command successfully returns Hello From Docker , then you're good to go. Now we start with the installation of MindsDB on our Droplet. Step 7: Now we will use the following commands in sequence to get done with the installation of MindDB Sever. docker pull mindsdb/mindsdb This should pull the latest Production image to our Droplet. You can also use the latest Beta version as well using the following command. docker pull mindsdb/mindsdb_beta Step 8: After that, we need to publish the ports so that we can hit the endpoints and communicate with the MindsDB Server in our Droplet. So, we will first expose the MindsDB GUI Port and then the MySQL Port that we will be using for now with the commands below. MindsDB GUI with MySQL API docker run -p 47334:47334 -p 47335:47335 mindsdb/mindsdb You can always follow the MindsDB Getting Started documentation if you need further information or want to install MindsDB by any other means other than Docker. Step 9: You might see a warning on the console after you run the above command that some data sources may not be available and you can always find details on how to add the specific data source on the MindDB Repo . For now, we will add the data source for MSSQL using the command below. Open another console for the droplet and run it if MindsDB is still running in the first console. pip install mindsdb-datasources[mssql] NOTE: You have to install python first to be able to use pip . Run the following to get it installed. apt install python3-pip You may encounter a few errors with regards to the versioning of pandas and scramp which you can ignore. Step 10: Now you can access the MindsDB GUI using the Droplet IPv4:47334 . Make sure you have turned off any VPN service you're using or else you may not be able to connect to the GUI using the URL. Step 11: This step enables us to connect a database client to our MindsDB server. For now, I would be using DBeaver to do the same. You can also connect your local MySQL server following the steps here . NOTE: You should follow the local deployment steps instead of cloud as this is a local instance hosted on the cloud and not the official MindsDB cloud edition. The default username is mindsdb and the default password is empty. We will first need to define the connection settings in Dbeaver before we can connect it. Always make sure you're using MySQL only or MySQL8 or higher from the available options. Click on Next and fill in the following details in the upcoming screen. Hostname : Your Droplet IPv4 Port : 47335 Username : mindsdb Password : Leave it empty. Now hit the Test Connection and once it returns success, click on Finish . NOTE: If you're running it for the first time, it may ask you to download some additional driver files. Check Force Download/Overwrite and hit `Download to proceed. Tables in MindsDB \u00b6 Once connected to the mindsdb database, it will contain 3 tables predictors , commands and datasources . You can simply run a query show tables; to see these as shown in the snippet above. The Predictors table contains all the newly trained ML models as a new record. Each column in the Predictors table contains information about each of these models. You can always find more information by visiting MindsDB Documentation page. This concludes the tutorial on how to deploy the MindsDB server on a Digital Ocean Droplet and connect to it using a local client. Please drop a like let me know in the comments if you found this useful or have any other suggestions. NOTE: The dashboard images belong to the official platforms of Digital Ocean and MindsDB respectively and are used here only for illustrative purposes.

CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . home_rentals_model FROM db_integration ( SELECT * FROM house_rentals_data ) as rentals PREDICT rental_price as price ; With this, we will use all columns from the dataset above to predict the value in rental_price . Create from a file datasource \u00b6 If you have uploaded a file from the GUI, you can specify files as the datasource: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . home_rentals_model FROM files ( SELECT * FROM house_rentals_data ) as rentals PREDICT rental_price as price ; SELECT Predictor status \u00b6 After you run the CREATE PREDICTOR statement, you can check the status of the training model, by selecting from mindsdb.predictors table: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'predictor_name' ; SELECT Predictor example \u00b6 To check the training status for the home_rentals_model run: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'home_rentals_model' ; Time Series keywords \u00b6 To train a timeseries model, MindsDB provides additional keywords. ORDER BY - keyword is used as the column that defines the time series order by, these can be a date, or anything that defines the sequence of events to order the data by descending (DESC) or ascending (ASC) order. (The default order will always be ASC ). WINDOW - keyword specifies the number of rows to \"look back\" into when making a prediction after the rows are ordered by the order_by column and split into groups. This could be used to specify something like \"Always use the previous 10 rows\". HORIZON - (OPTIONAL, default value is 1) keyword specifies the number of future predictions. GROUP BY - (OPTIONAL) keyword is used to group the rows that make a partition, for example, if you want to forecast inventory for all items in a store, you can partition the data by product_id, meaning that each product_id has its own time series.

CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . debt_model FROM income_table PREDICT debt ; MindsDB provides the CREATE PREDICTOR statement. When we execute this statement, the predictive model works in the background, automatically creating a vector representation of the data that can be visualized as follows. Let\u2019s now look for the debt value of some random income value. To get the approximated debt value, we query the debt_model and not the income table.

Of course, if you want to, you can tune things manually inside MindsDB with a declarative syntax caled JSON-AI, but we will not cover it in this article. DISCLAIMER: Please note that predicting Bitcoin price is just an example for showing MindsDB technology and you are solely responsible for any results you may get in real life, if you use this information for real trading purposes. Please note, that you can also follow this tutorial with other data you have. Pre-requisites \u00b6 First, you need MindsDB installed. If you want to use MindsDB locally, you need to install MindsDB with Docker or Python . However, if you want to use MindsDB without installing it locally, you can use Cloud Mindsdb . In this tutorial, I'm using MindsDB Cloud, because it is easy to set up in just 2 minutes and it has a great free tier. Second, you need a MySQL client to connect to MindsDB MYSQL API. Connect your database \u00b6 You must first connect MindsDB to the database where the record is stored. In the left navigation, click Database, click ADD DATABASE. And you must provide all the necessary parameters to connect to the database. Supported Database - select the database that you want to connect to Integrations Name - add a name to the integration, here I'm using 'mysql' but you can name it as you like Database - the database name Host - database hostname Port - database port Username - database user Password - user's password Then, click on CONNECT. The next step is to use the MySQL client to connect to MindsDB\u2019s MySQL API, train a new model, and make a prediction. Connect to MindsDB\u2019s MySQL API \u00b6 In this tutorial I'm using MySQL command-line client, but you can also follow up with the one that works the best for you, like Dbeaver. The first step is to use the MindsDB Cloud user to connect to the MindsDB MySQL API, using this command: You need to specify the hostname and user name explicitly, as well as a password for connecting. Click enter and you are connected to MindsDB API. If you have an authentication error, please make sure you are providing the email address you have used to create an account on MindsDB Cloud. Data \u00b6 Now, let's show the databases. There are 4 databases, and the MySQL database is the database that I've connected to MindsDB. Let's check the MySQL database. There are 3 tables, and in this tutorial, we will use the Bitcoin table. And let's check what is inside this table. These tables have 5 columns: date, open price, the highest price of the day, lowest price of the day, and close price. The column we want to forecast is close price. Create the model \u00b6 Now, to create the model let's move to MindsDB database. and let's see what's inside. There are 2 tables, predictors, and commands. Predictors contain your predictors record, and commands contain your last commands used. To train a new machine learning model we will need to CREATE PREDICTOR as a new record inside the predictors table, and using this command: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . predictor_name FROM integration_name ( SELECT column_name , column_name2 FROM table_name ) as ds_name PREDICT column_target as column_alias ORDER BY column_orderby WINDOW num_window HORIZON num_horizon USING { \"is_timeseries\" : \"Yes\" } The values that we need to provide are: predictor_name (string) - The name of the model. integration_name (string) - The name of the connection to your database. ds_name (string) - the name of the dataset you want to create, it's optional if you don't specify this value MindsDB will generate by itself. column_target (string) - The feature you want to predict. column_alias - Alias name of the feature you want to predict. column_orderby - The column to order the data, for time series this should be the date/time column. num_window - keyword specifies the number of rows to \"look back\" into when making a prediction after the rows are ordered by the order_by column and split into groups. This could be used to specify something like \"Always use the previous 10 rows\". num_horizon - keyword specifies the number of future predictions. So, use this command to create the models: If there's no error, that means your model is created and training. To see if your model is finished, use this command: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = predictor_name ; And values that we need to provide are: predictor_name (string) - The name of the model. If the model is finished, it will look like this. The model has been created! and the accuracy is 99%! Create the prediction \u00b6 Now you are in the last step of this tutorial, creating the prediction. To create a prediction you can use this command: SELECT target_variable , target_variable_explain FROM model_table WHERE when_data = '{\"column3\": \"value\", \"column2\": \"value\"}' ; And you need to set these values: - target_variable - The original value of the target variable. - target_variable_confidence - Model confidence score. - target_variable_explain - JSON object that contains additional information as confidence_lower_bound, confidence_upper_bound, anomaly, truth. - when_data - The data to make the predictions from(WHERE clause params). Finally, we have created a Bitcoin forecasting model using SQL and MindsDB. Yayyy! Conclusions \u00b6 As you can see it is very easy to start making predictions with machine learning even without being a data scientist! Feel free to check this yourself! MindsDB free cloud account is fast to set up and has more than enough to give it a try. Or use the open source version if you want to.","title":"Forecast Bitcoin price using MindsDB"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/bitcoin-forecasting/#forecast-bitcoin-price-using-mindsdb","text":"Level: Easy Dataset: Coinbase 2017-2018 Bitcoin data Bitcoin is a digital currency that uses blockchain technology, Bitcoin can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.

The dataset being used for this tutorial. Get it from Kaggle . Determining Body Fat Percentage \u00b6 Machine Learning powered data analysis can be performed quickly and efficiently by MindsDB to enable individuals to make accurate predictions for certain metrics based on a variety of associated values. MindsDB enables you to make predictions automatically using just SQL commands, all the ML workflow is automated, and abstracted as virtual \u201cAI tables\u201d in your database so you may start getting insights from forecasts right away. In this tutorial, we'll be using MindsDB and a MySQL database to predict body fat percentage based on several body part measurement criteria. Data Overview \u00b6 For this tutorial, we'll be using the Body Fat Prediction dataset available at Kaggle . Each row represents one person and we'll train an ML model to help us predict an individual's body fat percentage using MindsDB. Below is a short description of each feature of the data: - Density: Individual's body density as determined by underwater weighing (float) - BodyFat: The individual's determined body fat percentage (float). This is what we want to predict - Age: Age of the individual (int) - Weight: Weight of the individual in pounds (float) - Height: Height of the individual in inches (float) - Neck: Circumference of the individual's neck in cm (float) - Chest: Circumference of the individual's chest in cm (float) - Abdomen: Circumference of the individual's abdomen in cm (float) - Hip: Circumference of the individual's hips in cm (float) - Thigh: Circumference of the individual's thigh in cm (float) - Knee: Circumference of the individual's knee in cm (float) - Ankle: Circumference of the individual's ankle in cm (float) - Biceps: Circumference of the individual's biceps in cm (float) - Forearm: Circumference of the individual's forearm in cm (float) - Wrist: Circumference of the individual's wrist in cm (float) Upload a file \u00b6 Click on Files icon to go to datasets page Click on FILE UPLOAD button to upload file into MindsDB Connect to MindsDB SQL Sever \u00b6 mysql - h cloud . mindsdb . com --port 3306 -u username@email.com -p USE mindsdb ; Create a predictor \u00b6 Now, we have to create a predictor based on the following syntax: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . predictor_name FROM files ( SELECT column_name , column_name2 FROM file_name ) as ds_name PREDICT column_name as column_alias ; For our case, we'll enter the following command: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . bodyfat_predictor FROM files ( SELECT * FROM bodyfat ) PREDICT Bodyfat ; You should see output similar to the following: Query OK, 0 rows affected (3.077 sec) At this point, the predictor will immediately begin training. Check the status of the training by entering the command: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'bodyfat_predictor' ; When complete, you should see output similar to the following: +-------------------+----------+--------------------+---------+-------------------+------------------+ | name | status | accuracy | predict | select_data_query | training_options | +-------------------+----------+--------------------+---------+-------------------+------------------+ | bodyfat_predictor | complete | 0.9909730079130395 | BodyFat | | | +-------------------+----------+--------------------+---------+-------------------+------------------+ 1 row in set (0.101 sec) As you can see, the predictor training has completed with an accuracy of approximately 99%. At this point, you have successfully trained an ML model for our Body Fat Prediction dataset! Using SQL Commands to Make Predictions \u00b6 Now, we can query the model and make predictions based on our input data by using SQL statements. Let's imagine an individual aged 25, with a body density of 1.08, a weight of 170lb, a height of 70in, a neck circumference of 38.1cm, a chest circumference of 103.5cm, an abdomen circumference of 85.4cm, a hip circumference of 102.2cm, a thigh circumference of 63.0cm, a knee circumference of 39.4cm, an ankle circumference of 22.8cm, a biceps circumference of 33.3cm, a forearm circumference of 28.7cm, and a wrist circumference of 18.3cm. We can predict this person's body fat percentage by issuing the following command: SELECT BodyFat , BodyFat_confidence , BodyFat_explain FROM mindsdb . bodyfat_predictor WHERE Density = 1 . 08 AND Age = 25 AND Weight = 170 AND Height = 70 AND Neck = 38 . 1 AND Chest = 103 . 5 AND Abdomen = 85 . 4 AND Hip = 102 . 2 AND Thigh = 63 . 0 AND Knee = 39 . 4 AND Ankle = 22 . 8 AND Biceps = 33 . 3 AND Forearm = 28 . 7 AND Wrist = 18 . 3 ; This should return output similar to: +-------------------+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | BodyFat | BodyFat_confidence | Info | +-------------------+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 8.968581383955318 | 0.99 | {\"predicted_value\": 8.968581383955318, \"confidence\": 0.99, \"confidence_lower_bound\": 5.758912817402102, \"confidence_upper_bound\": 12.178249950508533, \"anomaly\": null, \"truth\": null} | +-------------------+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 1 row in set (0.464 sec) As you can see, with around 99% confidence, MindsDB predicted the body fat percentage for this individual at 8.97%. You can at this point feel free to alter the prospective individual's bodypart measurement parameters and make additional prediction queries if you'd like. Making Batch Predictions using the JOIN Command \u00b6 The above example showed how to make predictions for a single individual's bodyfat, but what if you had a table of bodypart measurements for a number of individuals, and wanted to make predictions for them all? This is possible using the JOIN command , which allows for the combining of rows from a database table and the prediction model table on a related column. The basic syntax to use the JOIN command is: SELECT t . column_name1 , t . column_name2 , FROM integration_name . table AS t JOIN mindsdb . predictor_name AS p WHERE t . column_name IN ( value1 , value2 , ...); For our purposes, we'll re-use the original data set, taking the Age, Density, Weight, Height, Neck circumference, Chest circumference, Abdomen circumference, and Hip circumference fields. We'll also include the original BodyFat percentage to compare our predicted values against the originals. Execute the following command: SELECT t . Age , t . Density , t . Weight , t . Height , t . Neck , t . Chest , t . Abdomen , t . Hip , t . BodyFat , p . BodyFat AS predicted_BodyFat FROM bodyfat_integration . bodyfat AS t JOIN mindsdb . bodyfat_predictor AS p LIMIT 5 ; This should return an output table similar to the following: +------+---------+--------+--------+------+-------+---------+-------+---------+--------------------+ | Age | Density | Weight | Height | Neck | Chest | Abdomen | Hip | BodyFat | predicted_BodyFat | +------+---------+--------+--------+------+-------+---------+-------+---------+--------------------+ | 23 | 1.0708 | 154.25 | 67.75 | 36.2 | 93.1 | 85.2 | 94.5 | 12.3 | 12.475132275112655 | | 22 | 1.0853 | 173.25 | 72.25 | 38.5 | 93.6 | 83.0 | 98.7 | 6.1 | 6.07133439184195 | | 22 | 1.0414 | 154.0 | 66.25 | 34.0 | 95.8 | 87.9 | 99.2 | 25.3 | 25.156538398443754 | | 26 | 1.0751 | 184.75 | 72.25 | 37.4 | 101.8 | 86.4 | 101.2 | 10.4 | 10.696461885516461 | | 24 | 1.034 | 184.25 | 71.25 | 34.4 | 97.3 | 100.0 | 101.9 | 28.7 | 28.498772660802427 | +------+---------+--------+--------+------+-------+---------+-------+---------+--------------------+ 5 rows in set (1.091 sec) As you can see, a prediction has been generated for each row in the input table. Additionally, our predicted bodyfat percentages align closely with the original values! Note that even though we chose only to display the Age, Density, Weight, Height, Neck, Chest, Abdomen, and Hip measurements in this example, the predicted_BodyFat field was determined by taking into consideration all of the data fields in the original bodyfat table (as this table was JOINed with the bodyfat_predictor table, from which we selected the specified fields). In order to make predictions based ONLY on the specified fields, we would have to create a new table containing only those fields, and JOIN that with the bodyfat_predictor table!

BodyFat AS predicted_BodyFat FROM bodyfat_integration . bodyfat AS t JOIN mindsdb . bodyfat_predictor AS p LIMIT 5 ; This should return an output table similar to the following: +------+---------+--------+--------+------+-------+---------+-------+---------+--------------------+ | Age | Density | Weight | Height | Neck | Chest | Abdomen | Hip | BodyFat | predicted_BodyFat | +------+---------+--------+--------+------+-------+---------+-------+---------+--------------------+ | 23 | 1.0708 | 154.25 | 67.75 | 36.2 | 93.1 | 85.2 | 94.5 | 12.3 | 12.475132275112655 | | 22 | 1.0853 | 173.25 | 72.25 | 38.5 | 93.6 | 83.0 | 98.7 | 6.1 | 6.07133439184195 | | 22 | 1.0414 | 154.0 | 66.25 | 34.0 | 95.8 | 87.9 | 99.2 | 25.3 | 25.156538398443754 | | 26 | 1.0751 | 184.75 | 72.25 | 37.4 | 101.8 | 86.4 | 101.2 | 10.4 | 10.696461885516461 | | 24 | 1.034 | 184.25 | 71.25 | 34.4 | 97.3 | 100.0 | 101.9 | 28.7 | 28.498772660802427 | +------+---------+--------+--------+------+-------+---------+-------+---------+--------------------+ 5 rows in set (1.091 sec) As you can see, a prediction has been generated for each row in the input table. Additionally, our predicted bodyfat percentages align closely with the original values! Note that even though we chose only to display the Age, Density, Weight, Height, Neck, Chest, Abdomen, and Hip measurements in this example, the predicted_BodyFat field was determined by taking into consideration all of the data fields in the original bodyfat table (as this table was JOINed with the bodyfat_predictor table, from which we selected the specified fields). In order to make predictions based ONLY on the specified fields, we would have to create a new table containing only those fields, and JOIN that with the bodyfat_predictor table!

In order to do this your model will require some sort of API wrapper, for now we have two API specifications we support: MLflow and Ray Serve . The former supports importing already trained models and predicting with them from mindsdb. The later supports both training and predicting with external models. In order to use custom models there are three mandatory arguments one must past inside the USING statement: - url.predict , this is the url to call for getting predictions from your model - format , this can be either mlflow or ray_serve - dtype_dict , this is a JSON specifying all columns expected by their models, and their respective data types. For now, the mapping supports data types used by lightwood , our AutoML library. There's an additional optional argument if you want to train the model via MindsDB (only for Ray Serve): - url.train , which is the endpoint that will be called to train your model 1. Ray Serve \u00b6 1.1 Simple example - Logistic regression \u00b6 Ray serve is a simple high-throughput service that can wrap over your own ml models. In this example, we will train and predict with an external scikit-learn model. First, let's look at the actual model wrapped inside a class that complies with the above requirements: import ray from fastapi import Request , FastAPI from ray import serve import time import pandas as pd import json from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression app = FastAPI () ray . init () serve . start ( detached = True ) async def parse_req ( request : Request ): data = await request . json () target = data . get ( 'target' , None ) di = json . loads ( data [ 'df' ]) df = pd . DataFrame ( di ) return df , target @serve . deployment ( route_prefix = \"/my_model\" ) @serve . ingress ( app ) class MyModel : @app . post ( \"/train\" ) async def train ( self , request : Request ): df , target = await parse_req ( request ) feature_cols = list ( set ( list ( df . columns )) - set ([ target ])) self . feature_cols = feature_cols X = df . loc [:, self . feature_cols ] Y = list ( df [ target ]) self . model = LogisticRegression () self . model . fit ( X , Y ) return { 'status' : 'ok' } @app . post ( \"/predict\" ) async def predict ( self , request : Request ): df , _ = await parse_req ( request ) X = df . loc [:, self . feature_cols ] predictions = self . model . predict ( X ) pred_dict = { 'prediction' : [ float ( x ) for x in predictions ]} return pred_dict MyModel . deploy () while True : time . sleep ( 1 ) The important bits here are having train and predict endpoints. The train endpoint accept two parameters in the JSON sent via POST: - df -- a serialized dictionary that can be converted into a pandas dataframe - target -- the name of the target column The predict endpoint needs only one parameter: - df -- a serialized dictionary that can be converted into a pandas dataframe The training endpoints must return a JSON that contains the keys status set to ok . The predict endpoint must return a dictionary containing the prediction key, storing the predictions. Additional keys can be returned for confidence and confidence intervals. Once you start this RayServe-wrapped model you can train it using a query like this one: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . byom_ray_serve FROM mydb ( SELECT number_of_rooms , initial_price , rental_price FROM test_data . home_rentals ) PREDICT number_of_rooms USING url . train = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/my_model/train' , url . predict = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/my_model/predict' , dtype_dict = { \"number_of_rooms\" : \"categorical\" , \"initial_price\" : \"integer\" , \"rental_price\" : \"integer\" } , format = 'ray_server' ; And you can query predictions as usual, either by conditioning on a subset of input colums: SELECT * FROM byom_ray_serve WHERE initial_price = 3000 AND rental_price = 3000 ; Or by JOINING to do batch predicions: SELECT tb . number_of_rooms , t . rental_price FROM mydb . test_data . home_rentals AS t JOIN mindsdb . byom_ray_serve AS tb WHERE t . rental_price > 5300 ; Please note that, if your model is behind a reverse proxy (e.g. nginx) you might have to increase the maximum limit for POST requests in order to receive the training data. MindsDB itself can send as much as you'd like and has been stress-tested with over a billion rows. 1.2. Example - Keras NLP model \u00b6 For this example, we will consider a natural language processing (NLP) task where we want to train a neural network with Keras to detect if a tweet is related to a natural disaster (fires, earthquakes, etc.). Please download this dataset to follow the example. The code for the model here is a bit more complex than in section 1.1, but the same rules apply: we create a Ray Server based service that wraps around a Kaggle NLP Model which can be trained and then used for predictions: import re import time import json import string import requests from collections import Counter , defaultdict \u200b import ray from ray import serve \u200b import gensim import numpy as np import pandas as pd from tqdm import tqdm from nltk.util import ngrams from nltk.corpus import stopwords from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize from fastapi import Request , FastAPI from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer \u200b from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding , LSTM , Dense , SpatialDropout1D from tensorflow.keras.initializers import Constant from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam \u200b app = FastAPI () stop = set ( stopwords . words ( 'english' )) \u200b \u200b async def parse_req ( request : Request ): data = await request . json () target = data . get ( 'target' , None ) di = json . loads ( data [ 'df' ]) df = pd .

And ingest it into a table with the following schema: id INT , keyword VARCHAR ( 255 ), location VARCHAR ( 255 ), text VARCHAR ( 5000 ), target INT Note: specifics of the schema and how to ingest the csv will vary depending on your database. Next, we can register and train the above custom model using the following query: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . byom_ray_serve_nlp FROM maria ( SELECT text , target FROM test . nlp_kaggle_train ) PREDICT target USING url . train = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/nlp_kaggle_model/train' , url . predict = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/nlp_kaggle_model/predict' , dtype_dict = { \"text\" : \"rich_text\" , \"target\" : \"integer\" } , format = 'ray_server' ; Training will take a while given that this model is a neural network rather than a simple logistic regression. You can check its status with the query SELECT * FROM mindsdb.predictors WHERE name = 'byom_ray_serve_nlp'; , much like you'd do with a \"normal\" MindsDB predictor. Once the predictor's status becomes trained we can query it for predictions as usual: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . byom_ray_serve_nlp WHERE text = 'The tsunami is coming, seek high ground' ; Which would, hopefully, output 1 . Alternatively, we can try out this tweet to expect 0 as an output: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . byom_ray_serve_nlp WHERE text = 'This is lovely dear friend' ; If your results do not match this example, it could help to train the model for a longer amount of epochs. 2. MLFlow \u00b6 2.1 Simple example - Logistic Regression \u00b6 MLFlow is a tool that you can use to train and serve models, among other features like organizing experiments, tracking metrics, etc. Given there is no way to train an MLflow-wrapped model using its API, you will have to train your models outside of MindsDB by pulling your data manually (i.e. with a script), ideally using a MLflow run or experiment. The first step would be to create a script where you train a model and save it using one of the saving methods that MLflow exposes. For this example, we will use the model in this simple tutorial where the method is mlflow.sklearn.log_model ( here ), given that the model is built with scikit-learn. Once trained, you need to make sure the model is served and listening for input in a URL of your choice (note, this can mean your model can run on a different machine than the one executing MindsDB). Let's assume this URL to be http://localhost:5000/invocations for now. This means you would execute the following command in your terminal, from the directory where the model was stored: mlflow models serve --model-uri runs:/<run-id>/model With <run-id> given in the output of the command python train.py used for actually training the model. Next, we're going to bring this model into MindsDB: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . byom_mlflow PREDICT ` 1 ` -- `1` is the target column name USING url . predict = 'http://localhost:5000/invocations' , format = 'mlflow' , data_dtype = { \"0\" : \"integer\" , \"1\" : \"integer\" } We can now run predictions as usual, by using the WHERE statement or joining on a data table with an appropriate schema: SELECT ` 1 ` FROM byom_mlflow WHERE ` 0 `= 2 ; 2.2. Advanced example - Keras NLP model \u00b6 Same use case as in section 1.2, be sure to download the dataset to reproduce the steps here. In this case, we will take a look at the best practices when your model needs custom data preprocessing code (which, realistically, will be fairly common). The key difference is that we now need to use the mlflow.pyfunc module to both 1) save the model using mlflow.pyfunc.save_model and 2) subclass mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel to wrap the model in an MLflow-compatible way that will enable our custom inference logic to be called. Saving the model \u00b6 In the same script where you train the model (which you can find in the final section of 2.2) there should be a call at the end where you actually use mlflow to save every produced artifact: mlflow . pyfunc . save_model ( path = \"nlp_kaggle\" , python_model = Model (), conda_env = conda_env , artifacts = artifacts ) Here, artifacts will be a dictionary with all expected produced outputs when running the training phase. In this case, we want both a model and a tokenizer to preprocess the input text. On the other hand, conda_env specifies the environment under which your model should be executed once served in a self-contained conda environment, so it should include all required packages and dependencies. For this example, they look like this: # these will be accessible inside the Model() wrapper artifacts = { 'model' : model_path , 'tokenizer_path' : tokenizer_path , } # specs for environment that will be created when serving the model conda_env = { 'name' : 'nlp_keras_env' , 'channels' : [ 'defaults' ], 'dependencies' : [ 'python=3.8' , 'pip' , { 'pip' : [ 'mlflow' , 'tensorflow' , 'cloudpickle' , 'nltk' , 'pandas' , 'numpy' , 'scikit-learn' , 'tqdm' , ], }, ], } Finally, to actually store the model you need to provide the wrapper class that will 1) load all produced artifacts into an accesible \"context\" and 2) implement all required inference logic: class Model ( mlflow . pyfunc . PythonModel ): def load_context ( self , context ): # we use paths in the context to load everything self . model_path = context . artifacts [ 'model' ] self . model = load_model ( self . model_path ) with open ( context . artifacts [ 'tokenizer_path' ], 'rb' ) as f : self . tokenizer = pickle . load ( f ) def predict ( self , context , model_input ): # preprocess input, tokenize, pad, and call the model df = preprocess_df ( model_input ) corpus = create_corpus ( df ) sequences = self . tokenizer . texts_to_sequences ( corpus ) tweet_pad = pad_sequences ( sequences , maxlen = MAX_LEN , truncating = 'post' , padding = 'post' ) df = tweet_pad [: df . shape [ 0 ]] y_pre = self . model . predict ( df ) y_pre = np . round ( y_pre ) . astype ( int ) . flatten () . tolist () return list ( y_pre ) As you can see, here we are loading multiple artifacts and using them to guarantee the input data will be in the same format that was used when training. Ideally, you would abstract this even further into a single preprocess method that is called both at training time and inference time. Finally, serving is simple. Go to the directory where you called the above script, and execute mlflow models serve --model-uri ./nlp_kaggle . At this point, the rest is essentially the same as in the previous example. You can link the MLflow model with these SQL statements: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . byom_mlflow_nlp PREDICT ` target ` USING url . predict = 'http://localhost:5000/invocations' , format = 'mlflow' , dtype_dict = { \"text\" : \"rich text\" , \"target\" : \"binary\" } ; To get predictions, you can directly pass input data using the WHERE clause: SELECT target FROM mindsdb . byom_mlflow_nlp WHERE text = 'The tsunami is coming, seek high ground' ; Or you can JOIN with a data table. For this, you should ensure the table actually exists and that the database it belongs to has been connected to your MindsDB instance. For more details, refer to the same steps in the Ray Serve example (section 1.2). SELECT ta . text , tb . target as predicted FROM db_byom . test . nlp_kaggle_test as ta JOIN mindsdb . byom_mlflow_nlp as tb ; Full Script \u00b6 Finally, for reference, here's the full script that trains and saves the model.

First, let's look at the actual model wrapped inside a class that complies with the above requirements: import ray from fastapi import Request , FastAPI from ray import serve import time import pandas as pd import json from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression app = FastAPI () ray . init () serve . start ( detached = True ) async def parse_req ( request : Request ): data = await request . json () target = data . get ( 'target' , None ) di = json . loads ( data [ 'df' ]) df = pd .

The train endpoint accept two parameters in the JSON sent via POST: - df -- a serialized dictionary that can be converted into a pandas dataframe - target -- the name of the target column The predict endpoint needs only one parameter: - df -- a serialized dictionary that can be converted into a pandas dataframe The training endpoints must return a JSON that contains the keys status set to ok . The predict endpoint must return a dictionary containing the prediction key, storing the predictions. Additional keys can be returned for confidence and confidence intervals. Once you start this RayServe-wrapped model you can train it using a query like this one: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . byom_ray_serve FROM mydb ( SELECT number_of_rooms , initial_price , rental_price FROM test_data . home_rentals ) PREDICT number_of_rooms USING url . train = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/my_model/train' , url . predict = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/my_model/predict' , dtype_dict = { \"number_of_rooms\" : \"categorical\" , \"initial_price\" : \"integer\" , \"rental_price\" : \"integer\" } , format = 'ray_server' ; And you can query predictions as usual, either by conditioning on a subset of input colums: SELECT * FROM byom_ray_serve WHERE initial_price = 3000 AND rental_price = 3000 ; Or by JOINING to do batch predicions: SELECT tb . number_of_rooms , t . rental_price FROM mydb . test_data . home_rentals AS t JOIN mindsdb . byom_ray_serve AS tb WHERE t . rental_price > 5300 ; Please note that, if your model is behind a reverse proxy (e.g. nginx) you might have to increase the maximum limit for POST requests in order to receive the training data.

And ingest it into a table with the following schema: id INT , keyword VARCHAR ( 255 ), location VARCHAR ( 255 ), text VARCHAR ( 5000 ), target INT Note: specifics of the schema and how to ingest the csv will vary depending on your database. Next, we can register and train the above custom model using the following query: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . byom_ray_serve_nlp FROM maria ( SELECT text , target FROM test . nlp_kaggle_train ) PREDICT target USING url . train = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/nlp_kaggle_model/train' , url . predict = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/nlp_kaggle_model/predict' , dtype_dict = { \"text\" : \"rich_text\" , \"target\" : \"integer\" } , format = 'ray_server' ; Training will take a while given that this model is a neural network rather than a simple logistic regression. You can check its status with the query SELECT * FROM mindsdb.predictors WHERE name = 'byom_ray_serve_nlp'; , much like you'd do with a \"normal\" MindsDB predictor. Once the predictor's status becomes trained we can query it for predictions as usual: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . byom_ray_serve_nlp WHERE text = 'The tsunami is coming, seek high ground' ; Which would, hopefully, output 1 . Alternatively, we can try out this tweet to expect 0 as an output: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . byom_ray_serve_nlp WHERE text = 'This is lovely dear friend' ; If your results do not match this example, it could help to train the model for a longer amount of epochs.","title":"1.2. Example - Keras NLP model"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/byom/#2-mlflow","text":"","title":"2. MLFlow"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/byom/#21-simple-example-logistic-regression","text":"MLFlow is a tool that you can use to train and serve models, among other features like organizing experiments, tracking metrics, etc. Given there is no way to train an MLflow-wrapped model using its API, you will have to train your models outside of MindsDB by pulling your data manually (i.e. with a script), ideally using a MLflow run or experiment. The first step would be to create a script where you train a model and save it using one of the saving methods that MLflow exposes. For this example, we will use the model in this simple tutorial where the method is mlflow.sklearn.log_model ( here ), given that the model is built with scikit-learn. Once trained, you need to make sure the model is served and listening for input in a URL of your choice (note, this can mean your model can run on a different machine than the one executing MindsDB). Let's assume this URL to be http://localhost:5000/invocations for now. This means you would execute the following command in your terminal, from the directory where the model was stored: mlflow models serve --model-uri runs:/<run-id>/model With <run-id> given in the output of the command python train.py used for actually training the model. Next, we're going to bring this model into MindsDB: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . byom_mlflow PREDICT ` 1 ` -- `1` is the target column name USING url . predict = 'http://localhost:5000/invocations' , format = 'mlflow' , data_dtype = { \"0\" : \"integer\" , \"1\" : \"integer\" } We can now run predictions as usual, by using the WHERE statement or joining on a data table with an appropriate schema: SELECT ` 1 ` FROM byom_mlflow WHERE ` 0 `= 2 ;","title":"2.1 Simple example - Logistic Regression"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/byom/#22-advanced-example-keras-nlp-model","text":"Same use case as in section 1.2, be sure to download the dataset to reproduce the steps here. In this case, we will take a look at the best practices when your model needs custom data preprocessing code (which, realistically, will be fairly common). The key difference is that we now need to use the mlflow.pyfunc module to both 1) save the model using mlflow.pyfunc.save_model and 2) subclass mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel to wrap the model in an MLflow-compatible way that will enable our custom inference logic to be called.","title":"2.2. Advanced example - Keras NLP model"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/byom/#saving-the-model","text":"In the same script where you train the model (which you can find in the final section of 2.2) there should be a call at the end where you actually use mlflow to save every produced artifact: mlflow . pyfunc . save_model ( path = \"nlp_kaggle\" , python_model = Model (), conda_env = conda_env , artifacts = artifacts ) Here, artifacts will be a dictionary with all expected produced outputs when running the training phase. In this case, we want both a model and a tokenizer to preprocess the input text. On the other hand, conda_env specifies the environment under which your model should be executed once served in a self-contained conda environment, so it should include all required packages and dependencies. For this example, they look like this: # these will be accessible inside the Model() wrapper artifacts = { 'model' : model_path , 'tokenizer_path' : tokenizer_path , } # specs for environment that will be created when serving the model conda_env = { 'name' : 'nlp_keras_env' , 'channels' : [ 'defaults' ], 'dependencies' : [ 'python=3.8' , 'pip' , { 'pip' : [ 'mlflow' , 'tensorflow' , 'cloudpickle' , 'nltk' , 'pandas' , 'numpy' , 'scikit-learn' , 'tqdm' , ], }, ], } Finally, to actually store the model you need to provide the wrapper class that will 1) load all produced artifacts into an accesible \"context\" and 2) implement all required inference logic: class Model ( mlflow . pyfunc . PythonModel ): def load_context ( self , context ): # we use paths in the context to load everything self . model_path = context . artifacts [ 'model' ] self . model = load_model ( self . model_path ) with open ( context . artifacts [ 'tokenizer_path' ], 'rb' ) as f : self . tokenizer = pickle . load ( f ) def predict ( self , context , model_input ): # preprocess input, tokenize, pad, and call the model df = preprocess_df ( model_input ) corpus = create_corpus ( df ) sequences = self . tokenizer . texts_to_sequences ( corpus ) tweet_pad = pad_sequences ( sequences , maxlen = MAX_LEN , truncating = 'post' , padding = 'post' ) df = tweet_pad [: df . shape [ 0 ]] y_pre = self . model . predict ( df ) y_pre = np . round ( y_pre ) . astype ( int ) . flatten () . tolist () return list ( y_pre ) As you can see, here we are loading multiple artifacts and using them to guarantee the input data will be in the same format that was used when training. Ideally, you would abstract this even further into a single preprocess method that is called both at training time and inference time. Finally, serving is simple. Go to the directory where you called the above script, and execute mlflow models serve --model-uri ./nlp_kaggle . At this point, the rest is essentially the same as in the previous example. You can link the MLflow model with these SQL statements: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . byom_mlflow_nlp PREDICT ` target ` USING url . predict = 'http://localhost:5000/invocations' , format = 'mlflow' , dtype_dict = { \"text\" : \"rich text\" , \"target\" : \"binary\" } ; To get predictions, you can directly pass input data using the WHERE clause: SELECT target FROM mindsdb . byom_mlflow_nlp WHERE text = 'The tsunami is coming, seek high ground' ; Or you can JOIN with a data table. For this, you should ensure the table actually exists and that the database it belongs to has been connected to your MindsDB instance. For more details, refer to the same steps in the Ray Serve example (section 1.2).

From advanced machinery to specially selected crops. All the technology produces a lot of data that can be used for better adjustment of the farming process. One use case of machine learning in agriculture could be the selection of the best crop for a specific field to maximize the potential yield. Such problems are often called Classification Problems in machine learning. With MindsDB you can easily make automated machine learning predictions straight from your existing database. Even without advanced ML engineering skills, you can start leveraging predictive models that help you make better business decisions. In this tutorial, you will learn how to predict the best crop type based on field parameters using MindsDB and MariaDB . Pre-requisites \u00b6 Before you start make sure you have: Access to MindsDB. In this tutorial, we will use MindsDB Cloud . If you want you can also deploy mindsdb on your premises, Check out the installation guide for Docker or PyPi . Downloaded the dataset. You can get it from Kaggle . Access to a mysql-client. Docker Add your file to MindsDB \u00b6 MindsDB can integrates with many databases, in most scenarios your data will be stored in a database, if you decide to load this dataset into your database of choice, please follow instructions here as to how to connect mindsdb to your database . In this tutorial, you simply upload the kaggle file Crop_recommendation.csv to MindsDB via the MindsDB adming GUI, In this tutorial, we are using cloud.mindsdb.com . Alternatively, remember that if you are using a local deployment you will have to point your browser to 127.0.0.1:47334 . In the main screen, select FILES > FILE UPLOAD . Then add your file and give it a name, in this tutorial we will name it crops . Click Upload , you should now see your file on the list of files. \ud83d\ude80 NOTE: Mindsdb SQL Server allows you to query your uploaded files using SQL, we will get to that right now. Connecting to your MindsDB SQL Server \u00b6 In this section you will connect to MindsDB with the MySQL API and explore what is there for you. First you need to connect to MindsDB through the MySQL API. To do so, use the following command. Remember to change the MindsDB Cloud username for the connection mysql -h cloud.mindsdb.com --port 3306 -u cloudusername@mail.com -p Note: If you are using a local deployment, please review Connect to your Local deployment After that you can list the provided databases. SHOW databases ; You will notice that there is a database called files . USE files ; You can explore your data SELECT * from crops limit 4 ; Create a predictor \u00b6 Now we can create a machine learning model with crops columns serving as features, and MindsDB takes care of the rest of ML workflow automatically. There is a way to get your hands into the insides of the model to fine tune it, but we will not cover it in this tutorial. Switch to the mindsdb database. USE mindsdb ; Use the following query to create a predictor that will predict the label ( crop type ) for the specific field parameters. CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . crop_predictor FROM files ( SELECT * FROM crops ) PREDICT label as crop_type ; After creating the predictor you should see a similar output: Query OK, 0 rows affected (11.66 sec) Now the predictor will begin training. You can check the status of the predictor with the following query. SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'crop_predictor' ; After the predictor has finished training, you will see a similar output. Note that MindsDB does model testing for you automatically, so you will immediately see if the predictor is accurate enough. +-----------------+----------+--------------------+---------+---------------+-----------------+-------+-------------------+------------------+ | name | status | accuracy | predict | update_status | mindsdb_version | error | select_data_query | training_options | +-----------------+----------+--------------------+---------+---------------+-----------------+-------+-------------------+------------------+ | crop_predictor | complete | 0.9954545454545454 | label | up_to_date | 2.55.2 | | | | +-----------------+----------+--------------------+---------+---------------+-----------------+-------+-------------------+------------------+ 1 row in set (0.29 sec) You are now done with creating the predictor! \u2728 Make predictions \u00b6 In this section you will learn how to make predictions using your trained model. To run a prediction against new or existing data, you can use the following query. SELECT label FROM mindsdb . crop_predictor WHERE N = 77 and P = 52 and K = 17 and temperature = 24 and humidity = 20 . 74 and ph = 5 . 71 and rainfall = 75 . 82 label: maize 1 row in set (0.32 sec) As we have used a real data point from our dataset we can verify the prediction. N, P, K, temperature, humidity, ph, rainfall, label 77, 52, 17, 24.86374934, 65.7420046, 5.714799723, 75.82270467, maize As you can see, the model correctly predicted the most appropriate crop type for our field. OK, we made a prediction using a single query, but what if you want to make a batch prediction for a large set of data in your database? In this case, MindsDB allows you to Join this other table with the Predictor. In result, you will get another table as an output with a predicted value as one of its columns.

In this tutorial you will learn how to use SQL queries to train a machine learning model and make predictions in three simple steps: Connect a database with customer's data to MindsDB. Use an CREATE PREDICTOR statement to train the machine learning model automatically. Query predictions with a simple SELECT statement from MindsDB AI Table (this special table returns data from an ML model upon being queried). Using SQL to perform machine learning at the data layer will bring you many benefits like removing unnecessary ETL-ing, seamless integration with your data, and enabling predictive analytics in your BI tool. Let's see how this works with a real world example to predict the probability of churn for a new customer of a telecom company. Note: You can follow up this tutorial by connecting to your own database and using different data - the same workflow applies to most machine learning use cases. Pre-requisites \u00b6 First, make sure you have successfully installed MindsDB. Check out the installation guide for Docker or PyPi install. Second, you will need to have mysql-client or DBeaver, MySQL WOrkbench etc installed locally to connect to MySQL API. Database Connection \u00b6 First, we need to connect MindsDB to the database where the Customer Churn data is stored. In the left navigation click on Database. Next, click on the ADD DATABASE. Here, we need to provide all of the required parameters for connecting to the database. Supported Database - select the database that you want to connect to Integrations Name - add a name to the integration Database - the database name Host - database host name Port - database port Username - database user Password - user's password Then, click on CONNECT. The next step is to use the MySQL client to connect to MindsDB\u2019s MySQL API and train a new model that shall predict customer churn. Connect to MindsDB\u2019s MySQL API \u00b6 I will use a mysql command line client in the next part of the tutorial but you can follow up with the one that works the best for you, like Dbeaver. The first step is to use the MindsDB Cloud user to connect to the MySQL API: mysql -h cloud.mindsdb.com --port 3306 -u theusername@mail.com -p In the above command, we specify the hostname and user name explicitly, as well as a password for connecting. If you got the above screen that means you have successfully connected. If you have an authentication error, please make sure you are providing the email address you have used to create an account on MindsDB Cloud. Data Overview \u00b6 In this tutorial, we will use the customer churn data-set . Each row represents a customer and we will train a machine learning model to help us predict if the customer is going to stop using the company products. Below is a short description of each feature inside the data. CustomerId - Customer ID Gender - Male or Female customer SeniorCitizen - Whether the customer is a senior citizen or not (1, 0) Partner - Whether the customer has a partner or not (Yes, No) Dependents - Whether the customer has dependents or not (Yes, No) Tenure - Number of months the customer has stayed with the company PhoneService - Whether the customer has a phone service or not (Yes, No) MultipleLines - Whether the customer has multiple lines or not (Yes, No, No phone service) InternetService - Customer\u2019s internet service provider (DSL, Fiber optic, No) OnlineSecurity - Whether the customer has online security or not (Yes, No, No internet service) OnlineBackup - Whether the customer has online backup or not (Yes, No, No internet service) DeviceProtection - Whether the customer has device protection or not (Yes, No, No internet service) TechSupport - Whether the customer has tech support or not (Yes, No, No internet service) StreamingTv - Whether the customer has streaming TV or not (Yes, No, No internet service) StreamingMovies - Whether the customer has streaming movies or not (Yes, No, No internet service) Contract - The contract term of the customer (Month-to-month, One year, Two year) PaperlessBilling - Whether the customer has paperless billing or not (Yes, No) PaymentMethod - The customer\u2019s payment method (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer (automatic), Credit card (automatic)) MonthlyCharges - The monthly charge amount TotalCharges - The total amount charged to the customer Churn - Whether the customer churned or not (Yes or No). This is what we want to predict. Using SQL Statements to train/query models \u00b6 Now, we will train a new machine learning model from the datasource we have created using MindsDB Studio. Switch back to mysql-client and run: use mindsdb; show tables; You will notice there are 2 tables available inside the MindsDB database. To train a new machine learning model we will need to CREATE PREDICTOR as a new record inside the predictors table as: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . predictor_name FROM integration_name ( SELECT column_name , column_name2 FROM table_name ) PREDICT column_name as column_alias ; The required values that we need to provide are: predictor_name (string) - The name of the model integration_name (string) - The name of connection to your database. column_name (string) - The feature you want to predict. To train the model that will predict customer churn run: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . churn_model FROM demo ( SELECT * FROM CustomerChurnData ) PREDICT Churn as customer_churn USING { \"ignore_columns\" : [ \"gender\" ] } ; What we did here was to create a predictor called customer_churn to predict the Churn and also ignore the gender column as an irrelevant column for the model. Also note that the ID columns in this case customerId will be automatically detected by MindsDB and ignored. The model training has started. To check if the training has finished you can SELECT the model name from the predictors table: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'churn_model' ; The complete status means that the model training has successfully finished. The next steps would be to query the model and predict the customer churn. Let\u2019s be creative and imagine a customer. Customer will use only DSL service, no phone service and multiple lines, she was with the company for 1 month and has a partner. Add all of this information to the WHERE clause. SELECT Churn , Churn_confidence , Churn_explain as Info FROM mindsdb . churn_model WHERE when_data = '{\"SeniorCitizen\": 0, \"Partner\": \"Yes\", \"Dependents\": \"No\", \"tenure\": 1, \"PhoneService\": \"No\", \"MultipleLines\": \"No phone service\", \"InternetService\": \"DSL\"}' ; With the confidence of around 82% MindsDB predicted that this customer will churn. One important thing to check here is the important_missing_information value, where MindsDB is pointing to the important missing information for giving a more accurate prediction, in this case, Contract, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges and OnlineBackup. Let\u2019s include those values in the WHERE clause, and run a new query: SELECT Churn , Churn_confidence , Churn_explain as Info FROM mindsdb . churn_model WHERE when_data = '{\"SeniorCitizen\": 0, \"Partner\": \"Yes\", \"Dependents\": \"No\", \"tenure\": 1, \"PhoneService\": \"No\", \"MultipleLines\": \"No phone service\", \"InternetService\": \"DSL\", \"OnlineSecurity\": \"No\", \"OnlineBackup\": \"Yes\", \"DeviceProtection\": \"No\", \"TechSupport\": \"No\", \"StreamingTV\": \"No\", \"StreamingMovies\": \"No\", \"Contract\": \"Month-to-month\", \"PaperlessBilling\": \"Yes\", \"PaymentMethod\": \"Electronic check\", \"MonthlyCharges\": 29.85, \"TotalCharges\": 29.85}' ;","title":"Customer Churn"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/customer-churn/#pre-requisites","text":"First, make sure you have successfully installed MindsDB.

It is known as a silent killer, as recent studies have shown that by the year 2040 the world's diabetic patients will reach 642 million. The need to analyse vast medical data to assist in the diagnoses, treatment and management of illnesses is increasing for the medical community. With the rapid development of machine learning, it has been applied to many aspects of medical health and is transforming the health care system. The vitality to intelligently transform information into valuable knowledge through machine learning has become more present in biosciences. With the use of predictive models, MindsDB can assist in classifying diabetic and non-diabetic patients or those who pose a high risk. This is just a small showcase on how MindsDB's machine learning will be able to assist in vastly enhancing the reach of illnesses, thereby making it more efficient and can revolutionize businesses and most importantly the health care system. In this tutorial we will be exploring how we can use a machine learning model to classify negative and positive cases for diabetes. MindsDB allows you to train your model from CSV data directly, however for this tutorial you will: Create & setup a new database. Load sample data into a table using the PGAdmin GUI Tool. Allow connections to the database using Ngrok. Setup a MindsDB connection to your local instance. Create a predictor using SQL. Pre-requisites \u00b6 For this tutorial, Docker is highly recommended. A docker-compose.yml file will be provided to get you started quickly. To ensure you can complete all the steps, make sure you have access to the following tools: A MindsDB instance. Check out the installation guide for Docker or PyPi . You can also use MindsDB Cloud . Optional: A PostgreSQL Database. You can install it locally or through Docker . Downloaded the dataset. You can get it from here Access to PGAdmin4 (provided with the docker-compose file). Optional: Access to ngrok. You can check the installation details at the ngrok website . Docker \u00b6 Create a new project directory named e.g. mindsdb-tutorial Inside your project directory: 2.1 Create a new file named docker-compose.yml . 2.2 Create another directory named data . 2.3 Download the CSV datafile and store it in your directory Open the docker-compose.yml file with any text-editor, copy the following and save. version: '3.5' services: postgres: container_name: postgres_container image: postgres environment: POSTGRES_USER: ${ POSTGRES_USER :- postgres } POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${ POSTGRES_PASSWORD :- changeme } PGDATA: /data/postgres volumes: - postgres:/data/postgres ports: - \"5432:5432\" network_mode: bridge restart: unless-stopped pgadmin: container_name: pgadmin_container image: dpage/pgadmin4 environment: PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: ${ PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL :- pgadmin4 @pgadmin.org } PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: ${ PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD :- admin } PGADMIN_CONFIG_SERVER_MODE: 'False' volumes: - pgadmin:/var/lib/pgadmin # Mounts local dir to docker container - ./data:/home ports: - \"5050:80\" network_mode: bridge restart: unless-stopped volumes: postgres: pgadmin: This compose stack features both a Postgres database with PGAdmin4 running on ports 5432 and 5050 respectively. For the database to connect to MindsDB we will use a tunneling program Ngrok to allow the remote database connection without exposing your public IP. Data will be loaded from a csv file using the import tool. Docker Volumes are used for persistent storage of data. To run, open a terminal in the project folder and run docker-compose up -d . If you do not have the Docker images locally, it will first download them from docker hub and might take. Setup the database \u00b6 After docker has started all the services In this section, you will create a Postgres database and a table into which you will then load the dataset. First, connect to your Postgres instance. There are cli options like pgcli . We will use a gui manager; pgAdmin The required details are specified within the compose file. Remember to change the username & password if you have a different one set up in. Open your browser and enter localhost:5050 in the Navigation bar. Setup or enter a master password. Create a new server connection by navigating to the right side of the page and right click on 'Server', select 'Create' and enter the required details. 3.1 For the purpose of the exercise, under the General Tab the Name entered is MIndsDB and the host name/address is localhost under the Connection tab. To create a new database, select the dropdown of the Server and navigate to 'Databases', right click on it and select 'Create' and then 'Databases'.Enter the required details. 4.1 For this exercise, the Database was given the name DIABETES_DATA under the General tab. Select the dropdown of the database created, navigate to 'Schema' and right click on it to select 'Create' and then 'Schema'. Enter the required details. Select the dropdown of the schema created and navigate to 'Tables' to right click on it and select 'Query Tool'. This will allow you to add a table with SQL code.The below code was used to create the table. CREATE TABLE Diabetes ( Number_of_times_pregnant INT , Plasma_glucose_concentration DECIMAL ( 6 , 3 ) , Diastolic_blood_pressure DECIMAL ( 6 , 3 ) , Triceps_skin_fold_thickness DECIMAL ( 6 , 3 ) , Two_Hour_serum_insulin DECIMAL ( 6 , 3 ) , Body_mass_index DECIMAL ( 6 , 3 ) , Diabetes_pedigree_function DECIMAL ( 6 , 3 ) , Age INT , Class varchar ( 100 ) ); 7. Import Data Before you import the data, please delete the first row as it is a table header. To import rows into your table, right click on the table name and select Import/Export . Under the Options tab, ensure the slider is set to Import . Select your file name and ensure that the delimiters are set. 8. Select the data By making a select query, the data that has been loaded can be verified. Navigate to the table name to right click and select 'SCRIPTS', then choose 'SELECT scripts'. Run the below query and see the results returned. SELECT * FROM \"DIABETES_DATA\" . diabetes ; You can use the below query structure to show your database SELECT * FROM \"Schema_name\" . table_name ; All the rows imported will be retrieved. Congratulations! You have completed setting up a Postgres database. Connect your database to MindsDB GUI \u00b6 Now we are ready to connect your database to MindsDB's GUI. For this exercise, we will be connecting to MindsDB Cloud as it is much more convenient for most users to use. To make our database available to MindsDB, we will run ngrok as our database instance is local. The following command can be run in docker or a terminal on your device to set up a ngrok tunnel. ngrok tcp [ db-port ] For this example the port number used is 5432. You should see a similar output: Session Status online Account myaccount (Plan: Free) Version 2.3.40 Region United States (us) Web Interface http://127.0.0.1:4040 Forwarding tcp://x.tcp.ngrok.io:15076 -> localhost:5432 The information required is by the forwarded address, next to 'Forwarding' select and copy x.tcp.ngrok.io:15076 Once you have copied the information, you can add it to the information requested by the MindsDB GUI which we will get to in a moment. For the next steps we will log into the MindsDB cloud interface. MindsDB Cloud is perfect if you are unable to install MindsDB on your device.

Machine learning technology, a subfield of artificial intelligence, is enabling scientists, clinicians and patients to detect it in the earlier stages and therefore save lives. Until now, building, deploying and maintaining applied machine learning solutions was a complicated and expensive task, because it required skilled personnel and expensive tools. But not only that. A traditional machine learning project requires building integrations with data and applications, that is not only a technical but also an organizational challenge. So what if machine learning can become a part of the standard tools that are already in use? This is exactly the problem that MindsDB is solving. It makes machine learning easy to use by automating and integrating it into the mainstream instruments for data and analytics, namely databases and business intelligence software. It adds an AI \u201cbrain\u201d to databases so that they can learn automatically from existing data, allowing you to generate and visualize predictions using standard data query language like SQL. Lastly, MindsDB is open-source, and anyone can use it for free. In this article, we will show step by step how to use MindsDB inside databases to predict the risk of heart disease for patients. You can follow this tutorial by connecting to your own database and using different data - the same workflow applies to most machine learning use cases. Let\u2019s get started! \u200b Pre-requisites \u00b6 \u200b If you want to install MindsDB locally, check out the installation guide for Docker or PyPi and you can follow this tutorial. If you are OK with using MindsDB cloud, then simply create a free account and you will be up and running in just one minute. Second, you will need to have a mysql client like DBeaver, MySQL Workbench etc. installed locally to connect to the MindsDB MySQL API. \u200b Connect to your data \u00b6 \u200b First, we need to connect MindsDB to the database where the Heart Disease data is stored. Open MindsDB GUI and in the left navigation bar click on Database. Next, click on the ADD DATABASE button. Here, we need to provide all of the required parameters for connecting to the database. \u200b * Supported Database - select the database that you want to connect to * Integrations Name - add a name to the integration * Database - the database name * Host - database host name * Port - database port * Username - database user * Password - user's password Then, click on CONNECT. The next step is to use the MySQL client to connect to MindsDB\u2019s MySQL API and train a new model that shall predict the risk of heart disease for a certain patient. \u200b How to use MindsDB \u00b6 \u200b MindsDB allows you to automatically create & train machine learning models from the data in your database that you have connected to in the previous step. MindsDB works via MySQL wire protocol, which means you can do all these steps through SQL commands. When it comes to making predictions, SQL queries become even handier, because you can easily make them straight from your existing applications or Business Intelligence tools that already speak SQL. The ML models are available to use immediately after being trained as if they were virtual database tables (a concept called \u201cAI Tables\u201d). So, let\u2019s see how it works. The first step is to connect to MindsDB\u2019s MySQL API. Go to your MySQL client and execute: \u200b mysql -h cloud.mindsdb.com --port 3306 -u theusername@mail.com -p \u200b In the above command, we specify the hostname and user name, as well as a password for connecting. If you use a local instance of MindsDB you have to specify its parameters. Please refer to the documentation . If you have an authentication error, please make sure you are providing the email address you have used to create an account on MindsDB Cloud. \u200b Data Overview \u00b6 \u200b For the example of this tutorial, we will use the heart disease dataset available publicly in Kaggle . Each row represents a patient and we will train a machine learning model to help us predict if the patient is classified as a heart disease patient. Below is a short description of each feature inside the data. \u200b * age - In Years * sex - 1 = Male; 0 = Female * cp - chest pain type (4 values) * trestbps - Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) * chol - Serum cholesterol in mg/dl * fbs - Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false) * restecg - Resting electrocardiographic results * thalach - Maximum heart rate achieved * exang - Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) * oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest * slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment * ca - Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy * thal - 1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversible defect * target - 1 or 0 (This is what we will predict) \u200b Using SQL Statements to automatically train ML models \u00b6 \u200b Now, we will train a new machine learning model from the datasource we have created. Go to your mysql-client and run: \u200b use mindsdb; show tables; \u200b You will notice there are 2 tables available inside the MindsDB database. To train a new machine learning model we will need to CREATE PREDICTOR as a new record inside the predictors table as: \u200b CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . predictor_name FROM integration_name ( SELECT column_name , column_name2 FROM table_name ) PREDICT column_name as column_alias ; \u200b The required values that we need to provide are: \u200b * predictor_name (string) - The name of the model * integration_name (string) - The name of the connection to your database. * column_name (string) - The feature you want to predict. \u200b To train the model that will predict the risk of heart disease as target run: \u200b CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . patients_target FROM db_integration ( SELECT * FROM HeartDiseaseData ) PREDICT target USING { \"ignore_columns\" : [ \"sex\" ] } ; \u200b \u200b What we did here was to create a predictor called patients_target to predict the presence of heart disease as target and also ignore the sex column as an irrelevant column for the model. The model has started training. To check if the training has finished you can SELECT the model name from the predictors table: \u200b SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'patients_target' ; \u200b The complete status means that the model training has successfully finished. Using SQL Statements to make predictions \u00b6 \u200b \u200bThe next steps would be to query the model and predict the heart disease risk. Let\u2019s imagine a patient. This patient\u2019s age is 30, she has a cholesterol level of 177 mg/dl, with slope of the peak exercise ST segment as 2, and thal as 2. Add all of this information to the WHERE clause. \u200b SELECT target as prediction , target_confidence as confidence , target_explain as info FROM mindsdb . patients_target WHERE when_data = '{\"age\": 30, \"chol\": 177, \"slope\": 2, \"thal\": 2}' ; \u200b With a confidence of around 99%, MindsDB predicted a high risk of heart disease for this patient. The above example shows how you can make predictions for a single patient. But what if you have a table in your database with many patients\u2019 diagnosis data, and you want to make predictions for them in bulk? For this purpose, you can join the predictor with such a table. SELECT * FROM db_integration . HeartDiseaseData AS t JOIN mindsdb . patients_target AS tb WHERE t . thal in ( '2' ); \u200b Now you can even connect the output table to your BI tool and for more convenient visualization of the results using graphs or pivots. Conclusion \u00b6 In this tutorial, you have seen how easy it is to apply machine learning for your predictive needs. MindsDB's innovative open-source technology is making it easy to leverage machine learning for people who are not experts in this field. However, MindsDB is a great tool for ML practitioners as well: if you are a skilled data scientist, you could also benefit from the convenience of deploying custom machine learning solutions within databases by building & configuring models manually through a declarative syntax called JSON-AI .

So please make sure you've visited Getting Started Guide and Getting Started with Cloud . You may start to use MindsDB by installing it locally or you can use the Cloud service. Let\u2019s use the cloud for this tutorial. Second, you need a MySQL client to connect to the MindsDB MySQL API. Can you accurately predict insurance costs? \u00b6 In this tutorial, you will learn how to predict insurance costs using MindsDB. This tutorial is very easy because you don't need to learn any machine learning algorithms, all you need to know is just SQL. The process looks like the following: First we will connect MindsDB to a database with past data so it can learn from it We will use a single SQL command that will tell MindsDB to train its predictor We will use the standard SQL Select statement to get predictions from AI Tables in MindsDB. Like if this data already exists! MindsDB will execute a complete Machine Learning workflow behind the scenes, it will determine data types for each column, normalize and encode it, train and test ML model. All this happens automatically, so it is very cool! Those who want to get their hands dirty with manual hyperparameters optimization, you can also do that with MindsDB using a declarative syntax called JSON-AI. So let's look at how it works using a real use case. For the demo purpose we will use a public dataset from Kaggle, but you are free to follow this tutorial with your own data. Connect your database \u00b6 First, you need to connect MindsDB to the database where the data is stored. Open MindsDB GUI and in the left navigation click on Database, then click on the ADD DATABASE. Here, you need to provide all of the required parameters for connecting to the database. Supported Database - select the database that you want to connect to Integrations Name - add a name to the integration, here I'm using 'mysql' but you can name it differently Database - the database name Host - database hostname Port - database port Username - database user Password - user's password Then, click on CONNECT. The next step is to use the MySQL client to connect to MindsDB\u2019s MySQL API, train a new model, and make a prediction. Connect to MindsDB\u2019s MySQL API \u00b6 Here I'm using MySQL command-line client, but you can also follow up with the one that works the best for you, like Dbeaver. The first step is to use the MindsDB Cloud user to connect to the MindsDB MySQL API, using this command: You need to specify the hostname and user name explicitly, as well as a password for connecting. Click enter and you are connected to MindsDB API. If you have an authentication error, please make sure you are providing the email address you have used to create an account on MindsDB Cloud. Data \u00b6 Now, let's show the databases. There are 4 databases, and the MySQL database is the database that I've connected to MindsDB. Let's check the MySQL database. There are 3 tables, and because the tutorial is about insurance cost prediction, we will use the insurance table. Let's check what is inside this table. So, these tables have 7 columns: age: The age of the person (integer) sex: Gender (male or female) bmi: Body mass index is a value derived from the mass and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m\u00b2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in meters (float) children: The number of children (integer) smoker: Indicator if the person smoke (yes or no) region: Region where the insured lives (southeast, northeast, southwest or northwest) charges: The insurance cost, this is the target of prediction (float) Create the model \u00b6 Now, to create the model, let's move to the MindsDB database, and see what's inside. There are 2 tables, predictors, and commands. Predictors contain your predictors record, and commands contain your last commands used. To train a new machine learning model we will need to CREATE PREDICTOR as a new record inside the predictors table, and using this command: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . predictor_name FROM integration_name ( SELECT column_name , column_name2 FROM table_name ) as ds_name PREDICT column_name as column_alias ; The values that we need to provide are: predictor_name (string) - The name of the model. integration_name (string) - The name of the connection to your database. ds_name (string) - the name of the dataset you want to create, it's optional if you don't specify this value MindsDB will generate by itself. column_name (string) - The feature you want to predict. column_alias - Alias name of the feature you want to predict. So, use this command to create the models: CREATE PREDICTOR insurance_cost_predictor FROM insurance_costs ( SELECT * from insurance ) PREDICT charges ; If there's no error, that means your model is created and training has started. To see if your model is finished, use this command: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = predictor_name ; And values that we need to provide are: predictor_name (string) - The name of the model. SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'insurance_cost_predictor' ; If the predictor is ready, it will look like this. The model has been created and trained! The reported accuracy is 75%. If you want to have more control over the model, head to lightwood.io to see how that can be customized. Make prediction \u00b6 Now you are in the last step of this tutorial, making the prediction. To make a prediction you can use this command: SELECT target_variable , target_variable_explain FROM model_table WHERE column3 = \"value\" AND column2 = value ; You need to set these values: target_variable - The original value of the target variable. target_variable_confidence - Model confidence score. target_variable_explain - JSON object that contains additional information as confidence_lower_bound, confidence_upper_bound, anomaly, truth. when_data - The data to make the predictions from(WHERE clause params). SELECT charges , charges_confidence , charges_explain as info FROM insurance_cost_predictor WHERE age = 20 AND sex = 'male' AND bmi = 33 . 20 AND children = 0 AND smoker = 'no' AND region = 'southeast' ; Finally, we have trained an insurance model using SQL and MindsDB. Conclusions \u00b6 As you can see it is very easy to start making predictions with machine learning even without being a data scientist! Feel free to check this yourself, MindsDB has an option of a free cloud account that is more than enough to give it a try.","title":"Insurance Cost"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/insurance-cost-prediction/#predict-insurance-cost-using-mindsdb","text":"Dataset: Medical Cost Personal Data Communtiy Author: Kinie K Kusuma","title":"Predict Insurance Cost using MindsDB"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/insurance-cost-prediction/#pre-requisites","text":"First, you need MindsDB installed.

Like if this data already exists! MindsDB will execute a complete Machine Learning workflow behind the scenes, it will determine data types for each column, normalize and encode it, train and test ML model. All this happens automatically, so it is very cool! Those who want to get their hands dirty with manual hyperparameters optimization, you can also do that with MindsDB using a declarative syntax called JSON-AI.

(if you are not familiar with AI-Tables, you can learn about them in here . Imagine that you are a data analyst at the Chicago Transit Authority. Every day, you need to optimize the number of buses per route to avoid overcrowded or empty buses. You need machine learning to forecast the number of rides per bus, per route, and by time of day. The data you have looks like the table below with route_id, timestamp, number of rides, and day-type (W = weekend) This is a difficult machine learning problem that is common in databases. A timestamp indicates that we are dealing with the time-series problem. The data is further complicated by the type of day (day-type) the row contains and this is called multivariate. Additionally, there is high-cardinality as each route will have multiple row entries each with different timestamps, rides, and day types. Let\u2019s see how we can use machine learning with MindsDB to optimize the number of buses per route and visualize the results. Set Up MindsDB \u00b6 First things first! You need to connect your database to MindsDB. One of the easy ways to do so is to create a MindsDB cloud account. If you prefer to deploy MindsDB locally, please refer to installation instructions via Docker or PyPI . Once an account is created you can connect to Snowflake using standard parameters like database name (in this case the Chicago Transit Authority), host, port, username, password, etc. Connect MindsDB to the Data for model training \u00b6 MindsDB works through a MySQL Wire protocol. Therefore, you can connect to it using any MySQL client. Here, we\u2019ll use the DBeaver database client and can see the Snowflake databases we are connected to. Step 1: Getting the Training Data \u00b6 We start by getting the training data from the database that we connected to our MindsDB cloud account. It is always good to first make sure that all the databases are present and the connections correct. show databases ; MindsDB comes with some built-in databases as follows: INFORMATION_SCHEMA stores information about MindsDB, MINDSDB stores metadata about the predictors and allows access to the created predictors as tables, DATASOURCE for connecting to data or uploading files. The SNF database is the database of the Chicago Transit Authority that we connected. It provides us with the training data. Let\u2019s check it. SELECT * FROM CHICAGO_TRANSIT_AUTHORITY . PUBLIC . CTA_BUS_RIDES_LATEST LIMIT 100 ; The training data consists of the number of rides per bus route and day. For example, on 2001-07-03, there were 7354 rides on bus route 3. Step 2: Training the Predictive Model \u00b6 Let\u2019s move on to the next step, which is training the predictive model. For that, we\u2019ll use the MINDSDB database. use mindsdb ; show tables MINDSDB database comes with the predictors and commands tables. The predictors table lets us see the status of our predictive models. For example, assuming that we have already trained our predictive model for forecasting the number of rides, we\u2019ll see the following. SELECT name , status FROM MINDSDB . PREDICTORS ; The process of training a predictive model using MindsDB is as simple as creating a view or a table. CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . rides_forecaster_demo FROM snf ( SELECT ROUTE , RIDES , DATE FROM CHICAGO_TRANSIT_AUTHORITY . PUBLIC . CTA_BUS_RIDES_LATEST WHERE DATE > '2020-01-01' ) PREDICT RIDES ORDER BY DATE GROUP BY ROUTE WINDOW 10 HORIZON 7 ; Let\u2019s discuss the statement above. We create a predictor table using the CREATE PREDICTOR statement and specifying the database from which the training data comes. The code in yellow selects the filtered training data. After that, we use the PREDICT keyword to define the column whose data we want to forecast. Next, there are standard SQL clauses, such as ORDER BY, GROUP BY, WINDOW, and HORIZON . We use the ORDER BY clause and the DATE column as its argument. By doing so, we emphasize that we deal with a time-series problem. We order the rows by date. The GROUP BY clause divides the data into partitions. Here, each of them relates to a particular bus route. We take into account just the last ten rows for every given prediction. Hence, we use WINDOW 10. To prepare the forecast of the number of bus rides for the next week, we define HORIZON 7. Now, you can execute the CREATE PREDICTOR statement and wait until your predictive model is complete. The MINDSDB.PREDICTORS table stores its name as rides_forecaster_demo and its status as training. Once your predictive model is ready, the status changes to complete. Step 3: Getting the Forecasts \u00b6 We are ready to go to the last step, i.e., using the predictive model to get future data. One way is to query the rides_forecaster_demo predictive model directly. Another way is to join this predictive model table to the table with historical data before querying it. We consider a time-series problem. Therefore, it is better to join our predictive model table to the table with historical data. SELECT tb . ROUTE , tb . RIDES AS PREDICTED_RIDES FROM snf . PUBLIC . CTA_BUS_RIDES_LATEST AS ta JOIN mindsdb . rides_forecaster_demo AS tb WHERE ta . ROUTE = \"171\" AND ta . DATE > LATEST LIMIT 7 ; Let\u2019s analyze it. We join the table that stores historical data (i.e., snf.PUBLIC.CTA_BUS_RIDES_LATEST) to our predictive model table (i.e., mindsdb.rides_forecaster_demo). The queried information is the route and the predicted number of rides per route. And the usage of the condition ta.DATE > LATEST (provided by MindsDB) ensures that we get the future number of rides per route. Let\u2019s run the query above to forecast the number of rides for route 171 in the next seven days. Now we know the number of rides for route 171 in the next seven days. We could do it in the same way for all the other routes. Thanks to the special SQL syntax that includes CREATE PREDICTOR, PREDICT, and > LATEST, MindsDB makes it straightforward to run predictors on our chosen data. Now, let\u2019s visualize our predictions. Visualizing the Results using Apache Superset \u00b6 Apache Superset is a modern, open-source data exploration and visualization platform designed for all data personas in an organization. Superset ships with a powerful SQL editor and a no-code chart builder experience. Superset ships with support for most SQL databases out of the box and over 50 visualization types. You can connect to the Snowflake database or your MindsDB database that has a Snowflake connection within. Upon starting up your Superset workspace, your earlier defined database connection is ready to use! So you have access to the Chicago Transit Authority data, as well as to the predictions made by MindsDB. Visualizing Data \u00b6 The two data sets that we are relevant for visualization are the stops_by_route and forecasts data sets. The stops_by_route data set contains the exact location of each bus stop for each bus route. And the forecasts data set stores the actual and predicted number of rides, confidence interval, and lower and upper bounds of prediction, per route and timestamp. Superset lets us visualize the stops_by_route data set as follows. Every bus route has a different color. Also, there is volatility associated with each bus route. Let\u2019s publish this chart to a new dashboard by clicking the +Save button, then switch to the Save as tab, and then type in \u201cRoutes Dashboard\u201d in the Add to Dashboard field. Now, let\u2019s craft a time-series line chart to visualize actual vs predicted riders. Let\u2019s look at the chart that presents the actual number of bus riders (in blue) and the predicted number of bus rides (in purple). Predictions made by MindsDB closely resemble the actual data, except for a short time during March 2020 when the large-scale lockdowns took place. There we see a sudden drop in the number of bus rides. But MindsDB took some time to cope with this new reality and adjust its predictions. Lastly, let\u2019s add a data zoom to this chart for end-users to zoom in on specific date ranges. Click the Customize tab and then click Data Zoom to enable it. Then, click the + Save button and publish to the same \u201cRoutes Dashboard\u201d. Let\u2019s head over to the dashboard now and customize it to make it more dynamic and explorable. Click Dashboards in the top nav bar and then select \u201cRoutes Dashboard\u201d from the list of dashboards. You can rearrange the chart positions by clicking the pencil icon, dragging the corners of the chart objects, and then clicking Save . Let\u2019s add some dashboard filters to this dashboard so dashboard consumers can filter the charts down to specific bus routes and volatility values. Click the right arrow (->) to pop open the filter tray. Then select the pencil icon to start editing this dashboard\u2019s filters. Create the following filters with appropriate filter names: A Value filter on the route column from the forecasts table. A Numerical range filter on the volatility column from the stops_by_route table. Click Save to publish these filters. Let\u2019s give these filters for a test ride! Use the routes filter to only show information for routes 1, 100, and 1001. We could zoom in to see the time during the first large-scale lockdowns in March 2020. For these particular routes, the predictions made by MindsDB are not so far off. Now, let\u2019s use our volatility filter to view only the routes with volatility values greater than 55. Conclusions: Powerful forecasting with MindsDB, your database, and Superset \u00b6 The combination of MindsDB and your database covers all the phases of the ML lifecycle. And Superset helps you to visualize the data in any form of diagrams, charts, or dashboards. MindsDB provides easy-to-use predictive models through AI Tables. You can create these predictive models using SQL statements and feeding the input data. Also, you can query them the same way you query a table. The easiest way to get started with Superset is with the free tier for Preset Cloud , a hassle-free and fully hosted cloud service for Superset. We encourage you to try some predictions with your own data, so please sign up for a free MindsDB cloud account and if you need any help with MindsDB, feel free to ask our Slack and Github communities.","title":"AI powered forecasts with MindsDB"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/mindsdb-superset-snowflake/#using-mindsdb-machine-learning-to-solve-a-real-world-time-series-problem","text":"Let\u2019s use these powerful AI tables in a real-world scenario.

We encourage you to try some predictions with your own data, so please sign up for a free MindsDB cloud account and if you need any help with MindsDB, feel free to ask our Slack and Github communities.","title":"Conclusions: Powerful forecasting with MindsDB, your database, and Superset"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/mushrooms/","text":"Mushrooms \u00b6 Dataset: Mushrooms Community Author: Chandre Tosca Van Der Westhuizen Mushrooms are a fleshy sporocarp of fungi which can either be edible or poisonous. It's usage dates back centuries with ancient Greek, Chinese and African cultures. They can have high nutritional value and medicinal properties which provides great health benefits. On the other side,some of these fungi can be toxic and consuming the wrong mushroom can have deadly consequences. It is important for industries across the world, like the food and health sector, to identify which type of mushrooms are edible and which are poisonous. We will explore how MindsDB's machine learning predictive model can make it easier classifying mushrooms and predicting which is safe to consume and which can make you ill. Pre-requisites \u00b6 For this tutorial, ensure you have access to docker Docker. A docker-compose.yml file will be provided to get you started quickly. To ensure you can complete all the steps, make sure you have access to the following tools: A MindsDB instance. Check out the installation guide for Docker or PyPi . You can also use MindsDB Cloud . Downloaded the dataset. You can get it from Kaggle Optional: Access to ngrok. You can check the installation details at the ngrok website . Optional- Recommended : Visual Studio Code Docker \u00b6 Create a new project directory named e.g. mindsdb-tutorial Inside your project directory: Create a new file named docker-compose.yml . Open the docker-compose.yml file with any text-editor, copy the following and save. version: '3.5' services: postgres: container_name: mindsdb_postgres_mushrooms image: postgres environment: POSTGRES_USER: postgres POSTGRES_PASSWORD: changeme POSTGRES_DB: Mushrooms PGDATA: /data/postgres volumes: # persist data storage in a docker container - mindsdb_postgres_mushrooms:/data/postgres ports: - \"5433:5432\" network_mode: bridge # restart: none volumes: mindsdb_postgres_mushrooms: This compose stack features both a Postgres database running on ports 5433 and 5432 respectively. We will install Python libraries and use python code in a Jupyter Notebook to create a Postgress database and load data into it in Visual Studio. For the database to connect to MindsDB we will use a tunneling program Ngrok to allow the remote database connection without exposing your public IP. Data will be loaded from a csv file using the import tool. Docker Volumes are used for persistent storage of data. To run, open a terminal in the project folder and run docker-compose up -d . If you do not have the Docker images locally, it will first download them from docker hub and might take a while. Creating a database \u00b6 The goal of creating a database in Visual Studio is to simplify the method used. We have two options- to create a python file with the relevant code in it or create a Jupyter Notebook. For the purpose of this exercise we are going to use Jupyter Notebook which will help execute the code. We will use the libraries sqlalchemy and pandas to create the database and load data into tables. To install the required Python libraries In a terminal, run pip3 install sqlalchemy pandas Please change the pip command if required for your system i.e. pip or python3 -m pip In Visual studio, create a new file with the extension '.ipynb' to create a Jupyter Notebook. Alternatively you can open a text editor and save the following code as a python file. from sqlalchemy import create_engine import pandas as pd # engine = create_engine('sqlite:///college.db', echo = True) username = 'postgres' password = 'changeme' db = 'Mushrooms' tablename = 'mushrooms' # database connection engine = create_engine ( f \"postgresql+psycopg2:// { username } : { password } @localhost:5433/ { db } \" , isolation_level = \"SERIALIZABLE\" , ) file_url = './mushrooms.csv' df = pd . read_csv ( file_url ) df . columns Drop rows with nul values and and store data to table. df . dropna ( inplace = True ) df . to_sql ( tablename , con = engine , if_exists = 'replace' , index = False ) If you are using a python file,open a terminal and execute python3 to run the code. If you are using Jupytor Notebook you can run the code by selecting the play buttons next to the cell blocks. Select python3 when prompted.

A shortcut is to select Ctrl+Shift+X and search for the management tool. Connecting to the database \u00b6 On the sidebar of visual studio, select the icon for the Postgress explorer. Select the + button by the option POSTGRESQL EXPLORER:POSTGRESQL to add a database connection. Add the hostname of the database. For this example, 127.0.0.1 was used. Enter the PostgreSQL user to authenticate. For this example it is postgres. Enter the password of the PostgreSQL user. Add the port number. For this example 5433 was used. Select the type of connection to use- use Secure Connection or Standard Connection. For this example we used Standard Connection. Add the name of the Database to connect to. For this example Mushrooms was used. Add the connection name. You can test the database by navigating to the Postgres Management Tool, selecting the hostname and database dropdowns , then right click on the table name and choose between the select options to return the values. Connecting to MindsDB Cloud \u00b6 We will now connect our database to MindsDB Cloud. First, we will run the ngrok command to establish a connection. Open a terminal and run the following command. ngrok tcp [ db-port ] For this example the port number used is 5433. You should see a similar output: Session Status online Account myaccount (Plan: Free) Version 2.3.40 Region United States (us) Web Interface http://127.0.0.1:4040 Forwarding tcp://6.tcp.ngrok.io:14789 -> localhost:5433 The forwarded address information will be required when connecting to MindsDB's GUI. Select and copy the 'Forwarding' information, in this case it is 6.tcp.ngrok.io:14789 , and keep this information for later. For the next steps we will log into the MindsDB cloud interface. MindsDB Cloud is perfect if you are unable to install MindsDB on your device. If you are not registered yet, feel free to follow the below guide. If you have already registered, skip the next steps to connect your database. MindsDB Studio Cloud Set Up \u00b6 You can visit this link and follow the steps in registering a MindsDB Cloud account. On the landing page, navigate to the left corner of the screen and select ADD DATABASE . Enter the required details. Too see an example, click here . Click Connect , you should now see your Postgres database connection in the main screen. You are now done with connecting MindsDB to your database! Create a predictor \u00b6 Now we are ready to create our own predictor. We will start by using the MySQL API to connect to MindsDB and with a single SQL command create a predictor. The predictor we will create will be trained to determine if a mushroom is edible or poisonous. Using the following command, you will connect through the MySQL API to MindsDB. Please note that the username and password to use will be the credentials you registered your MindsDB account with. mysql -h cloud.mindsdb.com --port 3306 -u cloudusername@mail.com -p If you are successfully connected, make sure you connect to MindsDB's database. USE mindsdb ; Use the following query to create a predictor that will predict the target_class for the specific field parameters. mysql > CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . mushroom_predictor FROM Mushrooms ( SELECT * FROM \"mushrooms\" ) as mushrooms_data PREDICT class ; After creating the predictor you should see a similar output: Query OK, 0 rows affected (12.18 sec) The predictor was created successfully and has started training. To check the status of the model, use the below query. mysql > SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'mushroom_predictor' ; After the predictor has finished training, you will see a similar output. Note that MindsDB does model testing for you automatically, so you will immediately see if the predictor is accurate enough. +--------------------+----------+----------+---------+---------------+-----------------+-------+-------------------+------------------+ | name | status | accuracy | predict | update_status | mindsdb_version | error | select_data_query | training_options | +--------------------+----------+----------+---------+---------------+-----------------+-------+-------------------+------------------+ | mushroom_predictor | complete | 1.0 | class | up_to_date | 2.61.0 | NULL | | | +--------------------+----------+----------+---------+---------------+-----------------+-------+-------------------+------------------+ 1 row in set (0.61 sec) The predictor has completed its training, indicated by the status column, and shows the accuracy of the model. You can revisit training new predictors to increase accuracy by changing the query to better suit the dataset i.e. omitting certain columns etc. Good job! We have successfully created and trained a predictive model \u2728 Make predictions \u00b6 In this section you will learn how to make predictions using your trained model. Now we will use the trained model to make predictions using a SQL query Use the following query using mock data with the predictor. SELECT class FROM mindsdb . mushroom_predictor WHERE cap - shape = 'x' AND cap - surface = 's' AND cap - color = 'n' AND bruises = 't' AND odor = 'p' AND gill - attachment = 'f' AND gill - spacing = 'c' AND gill - size = 'n' AND gill - color = 'k' AND stalk - shape = 'e' AND stalk - root = 'e' AND stalk - surface - above - ring = 's' AND stalk - surface - below - ring = 's' AND stalk - color - above - ring = 'w' AND stalk - color - below - ring = 'w' AND veil - type = 'p' AND veil - color = 'w' AND ring - number = 'o' AND ring - type = 'p' AND spore - print - color = 'k' AND population = 's' AND habitat = 'u' ; The result: *************************** 1. row *************************** class: p 1 row in set (1.19 sec) We have successfully created and trained a model that can predict if a model is edible or poisonous.

Manufacturing plants commonly use quality predictions to gain a competitive edge over their competitors, improve their products or increase their customers satisfaction. MindsDB is a tool that can help you solve quality prediction tasks easily and effectively using machine learning. MindsDB abstracts ML models as virtual \u201cAI Tables\u201d in databases and you can make predictions just using normal SQL commands.

It is in MindsDB terms a machine learning model, but all its complexity is automated and abstracted as a virtual \u201cAI Table\u201d. If you are an ML expert and want to tweak the model, MindsDB also allows you that (please refer to documentation). Use the following query to create a Predictor that will foretell the silica_concentrate at the end of our mining process. The row number is limited to 5000 to speed up training but you can keep the whole dataset. CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . process_quality_predictor FROM files ( SELECT iron_feed , silica_feed , starch_flow , amina_flow , ore_pulp_flow , ore_pulp_ph , ore_pulp_density , flotation_column_01_air_flow , flotation_column_02_air_flow , flotation_column_03_air_flow , flotation_column_04_air_flow , flotation_column_05_air_flow , flotation_column_06_air_flow , flotation_column_07_air_flow , flotation_column_01_level , flotation_column_02_level , flotation_column_03_level , flotation_column_04_level , flotation_column_05_level , flotation_column_06_level , flotation_column_07_level , iron_concentrate , silica_concentrate from process_quality FROM process_quality LIMIT 5000 ) PREDICT silica_concentrate as quality USING ; After creating the Predictor you should see a similar output: Query OK, 0 rows affected (2 min 27.52 sec) Now the Predictor will begin training. You can check the status with the following query. SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'process_quality_predictor' ; After the Predictor has finished training, you will see a similar output. +-----------------------------+----------+----------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------+ | name | status | accuracy | predict | select_data_query | training_options | +-----------------------------+----------+----------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------+ | process_quality_predictor | complete | 1 | silica_concentrate | | | +-----------------------------+----------+----------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------+ 1 row in set (0.28 sec) As you can see the accuracy of the model is 1 (i.e. 100%). This is the result of using a limited dataset of 5000 rows. In reality when using the whole dataset, you will probably see a more reasonable accuracy. You are now done with creating the predictor! \u2728 Make predictions \u00b6 In this section you will learn how to make predictions using your trained model. To run a prediction against new or existing data, you can use the following query. SELECT silica_concentrate , silica_concentrate_confidence , silica_concentrate_explain FROM mindsdb . process_quality_predictor WHERE iron_feed = 48 . 81 AND silica_feed = 25 . 31 AND starch_flow = 2504 . 94 AND amina_flow = 309 . 448 AND ore_pulp_flow = 377 . 6511682692 AND ore_pulp_ph = 10 . 0607 AND ore_pulp_density = 1 . 68676 ; The output should look similar to this. +--------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | silica_concentrate | silica_concentrate_confidence | Info | +--------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 1.68 | 0.99 | {\"predicted_value\": \"1.68\", \"confidence\": 0.99, \"confidence_lower_bound\": null, \"confidence_upper_bound\": null, \"anomaly\": null, \"truth\": null} | +--------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 1 row in set (0.81 sec) As you can see, the model predicted the silica concentrate for our data point. Again we can see a very high confidence due to the limited dataset. When making predictions you can include different fields. As you can notice, we have only included the first 7 fields of our dataset. You are free to test different combinations. In the previous example, we have made a prediction for a single data point. In a real scenario, you might want to make predictions on multiple data points. In this case, MindsDB allows you to Join this other table with the Predictor. In result, you will get another table as an output with a predicted value as one of its columns. Let\u2019s see how to make batch predictions. Use the following command to create the batch prediction. SELECT collected_data . iron_feed , collected_data . silica_feed , collected_data . starch_flow , collected_data . amina_flow , collected_data . ore_pulp_flow , collected_data . ore_pulp_ph , collected_data . ore_pulp_density , predictions . silica_concentrate_confidence as confidence , predictions . silica_concentrate as predicted_silica_concentrate FROM process_quality_integration . process_quality AS collected_data JOIN mindsdb . process_quality_predictor AS predictions LIMIT 5 ; As you can see below, the predictor has made multiple predictions for each data point in the collected_data table! You can also try selecting other fields to get more insight on the predictions.

It is in MindsDB terms a machine learning model, but all its complexity is automated and abstracted as a virtual \u201cAI Table\u201d. If you are an ML expert and want to tweak the model, MindsDB also allows you that (please refer to documentation). Use the following query to create a Predictor that will foretell the silica_concentrate at the end of our mining process. The row number is limited to 5000 to speed up training but you can keep the whole dataset. CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . process_quality_predictor FROM files ( SELECT iron_feed , silica_feed , starch_flow , amina_flow , ore_pulp_flow , ore_pulp_ph , ore_pulp_density , flotation_column_01_air_flow , flotation_column_02_air_flow , flotation_column_03_air_flow , flotation_column_04_air_flow , flotation_column_05_air_flow , flotation_column_06_air_flow , flotation_column_07_air_flow , flotation_column_01_level , flotation_column_02_level , flotation_column_03_level , flotation_column_04_level , flotation_column_05_level , flotation_column_06_level , flotation_column_07_level , iron_concentrate , silica_concentrate from process_quality FROM process_quality LIMIT 5000 ) PREDICT silica_concentrate as quality USING ; After creating the Predictor you should see a similar output: Query OK, 0 rows affected (2 min 27.52 sec) Now the Predictor will begin training. You can check the status with the following query. SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'process_quality_predictor' ; After the Predictor has finished training, you will see a similar output. +-----------------------------+----------+----------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------+ | name | status | accuracy | predict | select_data_query | training_options | +-----------------------------+----------+----------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------+ | process_quality_predictor | complete | 1 | silica_concentrate | | | +-----------------------------+----------+----------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------+ 1 row in set (0.28 sec) As you can see the accuracy of the model is 1 (i.e. 100%). This is the result of using a limited dataset of 5000 rows. In reality when using the whole dataset, you will probably see a more reasonable accuracy. You are now done with creating the predictor! \u2728","title":"Create a predictor"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/process-quality/#make-predictions","text":"In this section you will learn how to make predictions using your trained model.

Again we can see a very high confidence due to the limited dataset. When making predictions you can include different fields. As you can notice, we have only included the first 7 fields of our dataset. You are free to test different combinations. In the previous example, we have made a prediction for a single data point. In a real scenario, you might want to make predictions on multiple data points. In this case, MindsDB allows you to Join this other table with the Predictor. In result, you will get another table as an output with a predicted value as one of its columns. Let\u2019s see how to make batch predictions. Use the following command to create the batch prediction. SELECT collected_data . iron_feed , collected_data . silica_feed , collected_data . starch_flow , collected_data . amina_flow , collected_data . ore_pulp_flow , collected_data . ore_pulp_ph , collected_data . ore_pulp_density , predictions . silica_concentrate_confidence as confidence , predictions . silica_concentrate as predicted_silica_concentrate FROM process_quality_integration . process_quality AS collected_data JOIN mindsdb . process_quality_predictor AS predictions LIMIT 5 ; As you can see below, the predictor has made multiple predictions for each data point in the collected_data table!
